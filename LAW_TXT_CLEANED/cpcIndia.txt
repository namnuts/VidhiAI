Production of shop-book— (1) Save in so far as is otherwise provided by the Bankers' Books Evidence  Act, 1891 (18 of 1891), where the document on which the plaintiff sues is an entry in shop-book or other  account in his possession or power the plaintiff shall produce the book or account at the time of filing the  plaint, together with a copy of the entry on which he relies.

Denial to be specific— It shall not be sufficient for a defendant in his written statement to deny generally  the grounds alleged by the plaintiff, but the defendant must deal specifically with each allegation of fact of  which he does not admit the truth, except damages.  4. Evasive denial— Where a defendant denies an allegation of fact in the plaint, he must not do so evasively,  but answer the point of substance, Thus, if it is alleged that he received a certain sum of money, it shall not  be sufficient to deny that he received that particular amount, but he must deny that he received that sum or any part thereof, or else set out how much he received. And if an allegation is made with diverse circumstances, it shall not be sufficient to deny it along with those circumstances.  5. Specific denial— [149][(1)] Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied specifically or by necessary  implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the defendant, shall be taken to be admitted  except as against a person under disability :  Provided that the Court may in it discretion require any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than by such  admission.  [150] [(2) Where the defendant has not filed a pleading, it shall be lawful for the Court to pronounce judgment  on the basis of the facts contained in the plaint, except as against a person under a disability, but the Court  may, in its discretion, require any such fact to be proved.  (3) In exercising its discretion under the proviso to sub-rule (1) or under sub-rule (2), the Court shall have  due regard to the fact whether the defendant could have, or has, engaged a pleader.  (4) Whenever a judgment is pronounced under this rule, a decree shall be drawn up in accordance with such  judgment and such decree shall bear the date on which the judgment was pronounced.] 6. Particulars of set-off to be given in written statement— (1) Where in a suit for the recovery of money the  defendant claims to set-off against the plaintiff's demand any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable  by him from the plaintiff, not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Court, and both parties fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff's suit, the defendant may, at the first hearing of the suit, but not  afterwards unless permitted by the Court, presents a written statement containing the particulars of the debt  sought to be set-off.  (2) Effect of set-off—The written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross-suit so as to  enable the Court to pronounce a final judgment in respect both of the original claim and of the set-off : but  this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs payable to him  under the decree.  (3) The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant apply to a written statement in answer to a claim  of set-off.  Illustrations  (a) A bequeaths Rs. 2,000 to B and appoints C his executor and residuary legatee. B dies and D takes out  administration to B's effect, C pays Rs. 1,000 as surety for D: then D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set-off  the debt of Rs. 1,000 against the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the same character with respect to the  legacy as they fill with respect to the payment of Rs. 1,000.  (b) A dies intestate and in debt to B. C takes out administration to A's effects and B buys part of the effects  from C. In a suit for the purchase-money by C against B, the latter cannot set-off the debt against the price,  for C fills two different characters, one as the vendor to B, in which he sues B, and the other as  representative to A.  61  (c) A sues B on a bill of exchange. B alleges that A has wrongfully neglected to insure B's goods and is liable  to him in compensation which he claims to set-off. The amount not being ascertained cannot be set-off. (d) A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs. 500. B holds a judgment against A for Rs. 1,000. The two claims  being both definite, pecuniary demands may be set-off. (e) A sues B for compensation on account of trespass. B holds a promissory note for Rs. 1,000 from A and  claims to set-off that amount against any sum that A may recover in the suit. B may do so, for as soon as A  recovers, both sums are definite pecuniary demands.  (f) A and B sue C for Rs. 1,000 C cannot set-off a debt due to him by A alone.  (g) A sues B and C for Rs. 1000. B cannot set-off a debt due to him alone by A.  (h) A owes the partnership firm of B and C Rs. 1,000 B dies, leaving C surviving. A sues C for a debt of Rs.  1,500 due in his separate character. C may set-off the debt of Rs. 1,000. [151][6A. Counter-claim by defendant— (1) A defendant in a suit may, in addition to his right of pleading a  set-off under rule 6, set up, by way of counter-claim against the claim of the plaintiff, any right or claim in  respect of a cause of action accruing to the defendant against the plaintiff either before or after the filing of the suit but before the defendant has delivered his defence or before the time limited for delivering his  defence has expired. whether such counter-claim is in the nature of a claim for damages or not :  Provided that such counter-claim shall not exceed the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. (2) Such counter-claim shall have the same effect as a cross-suit so as to enable the Court to pronounce a  final judgment in the same suit, both on the original claim and on the counter-claim. (3) The plaintiff shall be at liberty to file a written statement in answer to the counter-claim of the defendant  within such period as may be fixed by the Court. (4) The counter-claim shall be treated as a plaint and governed by the rules applicable to plaints.  6B. Counter-claim to be stated— Where any defendant seeks to rely upon any ground as supporting a right  of counter-claim, he shall, in his written statement, state specifically that he does so by way of counter-claim.  6C. Exclusion of counter-claim— Where a defendant sets up a counter-claim and the plaintiff contends that  the claim thereby raised ought not to be disposed of by way of counter-claim but in an independent suit, the plaintiff may, at any time before issues are settled in relation to the counter-claim, apply to the Court for an order that such counter-claim may be excluded, and the Court may, on the hearing of such application make  such order as it thinks fit.  6D. Effect of discontinuance of suit— If in any case in which the defendant sets up a counter-claim, the suit  of the plaintiff is stayed, discontinued or dismissed, the counter-claim may nevertheless be proceeded with.  6E. Default of plaintiff to reply to counter-claim— If the plaintiff makes default in putting in reply to the  counter-claim made by the defendant, the Court may pronounce judgment against the plaintiff in relation to  the counter-claim made against him or make such order in relation to the counter-claim as it thinks fit.  6F. Relief to defendant where counter-claim succeeds— Where in any suit a set-off or counter-claim is  established as defence against the plaintiff's claim and any balance is found due to the plaintiff or the  defendant, as the case may be, the Court may give judgment to the party entitled to such balance.  6G. Rules relating to written statement to apply— The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant  shall apply to a written statement filed in answer to a counter-claim.]  7.

Duty of defendant to produce documents upon which relief is claimed by him— (1)Where a  defendant bases his defence upon a document in his possession or power, he shall produce it in Court when  62  the written statement is presented by him and shall, at the same time, deliver the document or a copy  thereof, to be filed with the written statement.  (2) A document which ought to be produced in Court by the defendant under this rule, but is not so produced,  shall not, without the leave of the Court, be received in evidence on his behalf at the hearing of the suit.  (3) Nothing in this rule shall apply to documents produced,—  (a) for the cross-examination of the plaintiff's witnesses, or  (b) in answer to any case setup by the plaintiff subsequent to the filing of the plaint, or  (c) handed over to a witness merely to refresh him memory].  9. Subsequent pleadings— No pleading subsequent to the written statement of a defendant other than by  way of defence to a set-off [155][or counter-claim] shall be presented except by the leave of the Court and  upon such terms as the Court thinks fit, but the Court may at any time require a written statement or  additional written statement from any of the parties and fix a time for presenting the same.  10. Procedure when party fails to present written statement called for by Court— Where any party from  whom a written statement [156][is required under rule 1 or 9] fails to present the same within the time  [157][permitted or fixed by the Court, as the case may be, the Court shall] pronounce judgment against him  or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit [158][and on the pronouncement of such judgment, a  decree shall be drawn up.]  ORDER IX- APPEARANCE OF PARTIES AND CONSEQUENCE OF NON-APPEARANCE 1.

(2) Material propositions are those propositions of law or fact which a plaintiff must allege in order to show a  right to sue or a defendant must allege in order to constitute his defence. (3) Each material proposition affirmed by one party denied by the other shall form the subject of distinct  issue.  (4) Issues are of two kinds :  (a) issues of fact,  (b) issues of law.  (5) At the first hearing of the suit the Court shall, after reading the plaint and the written statements, if any,  and [181][after examination under rule 2 of Order X and after hearing the parties or their pleaders], ascertain  upon what material propositions of fact or of law the parties are at variance, and shall thereupon proceed to frame and record the issues on which the right decision of the case appears to depend.

Court, if satisfied that agreement was executed in good faith, may pronounce judgment— Where the Court  is satisfied, after making such inquiry as it deems proper,—  (a) that the agreement was duly executed by the parties;  (b) that they have a substantial interest in the decision of such question as aforesaid, and  (c) that the same is fit to be tried and decided,  it shall proceed to record and try the issue and state its finding or decision thereon in the same manner as if  the issue had been framed by the Court.  and shall, upon the finding or decision on such issue, pronounce judgment according to the terms of the  agreement, and, upon the judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow  ORDER XV-DISPOSAL OF THE SUIT AT THE FIRST HEARING 1.

(2) Nothing in the foregoing sub-rule shall be deemed to preclude the Court from issuing any process in  execution of a decree without issuing the notice thereby prescribed, if, for reasons to be recorded, it  considers that the issue of such notice would cause unreasonable delay or would defeat the ends of justice.
