decree. 
Explanation VIII.—An issue heard and finally decided by a Court of limited jurisdiction, competent to decide such 
issue, shall operate as res judicata in as subsequent suit, notwithstanding that such Court of limited jurisdiction was not

service shall be made on the defendant in person, unless he has an agent empowered to accept service, in 
which case service on such agent shall be sufficient. 
13. Service on agent by whom defendant carries on business— (1) In a suit relating to any business or work 
against a person who does not reside within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court from which the 
summons is issued, service on any manager or agent, who, at the time of service, personally carries on such

member of the family, whether male or female, who is residing with him. 
Explanation.—A servant is not a member of the family within the meaning of this rule.]

service of the summons on his behalf, nor any other person on whom service can be made, the serving 
officer shall affix a copy of the summons on the outer door or some other conspicuous part of the house in which the defendant ordinarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain, and shall then return the original to the Court from which it was issued, with a report endorsed thereon or annexed thereto stating that he has so affixed the copy, the circumstances under which he did do, and the name and address

tender of the summons. 
19. Examination of serving officer.— Where a summons is returned under rule 17, the Court shall, if the 
return under that rule has not been verified by the affidavit of the serving officer, and may, if it has been so 
verified, examine the serving officer on oath, or cause him to be so examined by another Court, touching his proceedings, and may make such further enquiry in the matter as it thinks fit; and shall either declare that the summons has been duly served or order such service as it thinks fit. 
[128][19A. Simultaneous issue of summons for service by post in addition to personal service— (1) The 
Court shall, in addition to, and simultaneously with, the issue of summons for service in the manner provided 
in rules 9 to 19 (both inclusive), also direct the summons to be served by registered post, acknowledgement 
due, addressed to the defendant, or his agent empowered to accept the service, at the place where the 
defendant, or his agent, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain: 
Provided that nothing in this sub-rule shall require the Court to issue a summons for service by registered 
post, where, in the circumstances of the case, the Court considers it unnecessary. 
(2) When an acknowledgement purporting to be signed by the defendant or his agent is received by the 
Court or the postal article containing the summons is received back by the Court with an endorsement 
purporting to have been made by a postal employee to the effect that the defendant or his agent had refused to take delivery of the postal article containing the summons, when tendered to him, the Court issuing the 
summons shall declare that the summons had been duly served on the defendant : 
Provided that where the summons was properly addressed, prepaid and duly sent by registered post, 
acknowledgement due, the declaration referred to in this sub-rule shall be made notwithstanding the fact that the acknowledgement having lost or mislaid, or for other reason, has been received by the Court within thirty 
days from the date of the issue of the summons]. 
20. Substituted service— (1) Where the Court is satisfied that there is preason to believe that the defendant 
is keeping out of the way for the purpose of avoiding service, or that for any other reason the summons 
cannot be served in the ordinary way, the Court shall order the summons to be served by affixing a copy thereof in some conspicuous place in the Court-house, and also upon some conspicuous part of the house (if any) in which the defendant is known to have last resided or carried on business or personally worked for 
gain, or in such other manner as the Court thinks fit. 
[129][(1A) Where the Court acting under sub-rule (1) orders service by an advertisement in a newspaper, the 
newspaper shall be a daily newspaper circulating in the locality in which the defendant is last known to have 
actually and voluntarily resided, carried on business or personally worked for gain.] 
(2) Effect of substituted service—Service substituted by order of the Court shall be as effectual as if it had 
been made on the defendant personally. (3) Where service substituted, time for appearance to be fixed—Where service is substituted by order of the 
Court, the Court shall fix such time for the appearance of the defendant as the case may require. 20A. [Service of summons by post.] Rep. by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 ( 104 of

22. Service within presidency-towns of summons issued by Courts outside— Where as summons issued by 
any Court established beyond the limits of the towns of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay is to be served within 
any such limits, it shall be sent to the Court of Small Causes within whose jurisdiction it is to be served. 
23. Duty of Court to which summons is sent— The Court to which a summons is sent under rule 21 or rule 
22 shall, upon receipt thereof, proceed as if it had been issued by such Court and shall then return the 
summons to the Court of issue, together with the record (if any) of its proceedings with regard thereto.

behalf, where the defendant is, in the opinion of the Court, of a rank entitling him to such mark of 
consideration. 
(2) A letter substituted under sub-rule (1) shall contain all the particulars required to be stated in a summons, 
and, subject to the provisions of sub-rule (3), shall be treated in all respects as a summons. (3) A letter so substituted may be sent to the defendant by spot or by a special messenger selected by the 
Court, or in any other manner which the Court thinks fit; and where the defendant has an agent empowered 
to accept service, the letter may be delivered or sent to such agent. 
ORDER VI-PLEADINGS GENERALLY

[133][2. Pleading to state material facts and not evidence— (1) Every pleading shall contain, and contain 
only a statement in a concise form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or 
defnece as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved.

of the like character, nearly as may be, shall be used for all pleadings. 4. Particulars to be given where necessary— In all cases in which the party pleading relies on any 
misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, wilful default, or undue influence, and in all other cases in which 
particulars may be necessary beyond such as are exemplified in the forms aforesaid, particulars (with dates 
and items if necessary) shall be stated in the pleading.

        9. Effect of document to be stated.— Wherever the contents of any document are material, it shall be 
sufficient in any pleading to state the effect thereof as briefly as possible, without setting out the whole or any 
part thereof, unless the precise words of the document or any part thereof are material. 
10. Malice, knowledge, etc.,— Wherever it is material to allege malice, fraudulent intention, knowledge or 
other condition of the mind of any person, it shall be sufficient to allege the same as a fact without setting out 
the circumstances from which the same is to be inferred. 
11. Notice— Wherever it is material to allege notice to any person of any fact, mater or thing, it shall be 
sufficient to allege such notice as a fact, unless the form or the precise terms of such notice, or the 
circumstances from which such notice is to be inferred are material. 
12. Implied contract, or relation— Wherever any contract or any relation between any persons is to be 
implied from a series of letters or conversations or otherwise from a number of circumstances it shall be 
sufficient to allege such contract or relation as a fact, and to refer generally to such letter, conversations or circumstances without setting them out in detail. And if in such case the person so pleading desires to rely in the alternative upon more contracts or relations than one as to be implied from such circumstances, he may 
state the same in the alternative. 
13. Presumptions of law— Neither party need in any pleading allege any matter of fact which the law 
presumes in his favour or as to which the burden of proof lies upon the other side unless the same has first 
been specifically denied (e.g. consideration for a bill of exchange where the plaintiff sues only on the bill and not for the consideration as a substantive ground of claim.) 
14. Pleading to be signed— Every pleading shall be signed by the party and his pleader (if any) : 
Provided that where a party pleading is, by reason of absence or for other good cause, unable to sign the 
pleading it may be signed by any person duly authorized by him to sign the same or to sue or defend on his 
behalf. 
[134][14A. Address for service of notice— (1) Every pleading, when filed by a party, shall be accompanied by 
a statement in the prescribed form, signed as provided in rule 14, regarding the address of the party. 
(2) Such address may, from time to time, be changed by lodging in Court a form duly filled up and stating the 
new address of the party and accompanied by a verified petition. (3) The address furnished in the statement made sub-rule (1) shall be called the "registered address" of the 
party, and shall, until duly changed as aforesaid, be deemed to be the address of the party for the purpose of 
service of all processes in the suit of in any appeal from any decree or order therein made and for the purpose of execution, and shall hold good, subject as aforesaid, for a period of two years after the final 
determination of the cause or matter. 
(4) Service of any process may be effected upon a party at his registered address in all respects as though 
such party resided there at. (5) Where the registered address of a party is discovered by the court to be incomplete, false or fictitious, the 
Court may, either on its own motion, or on the application of any party, order— 
(a) in the case where such registered address was furnished by a plaintiff, stay of the suit, or 
(b) in the case where such registered address was furnished by a defendant, his be struck out and he be 
placed in the same position as if he had not put up and defence. 
(6) Where a suit is stayed or a defence is struck out under sub- rule (5), the plaintiff or, as the case may be, 
the defendant may, after furnishing his true address, apply to the Court for an order to set aside the order of 
stay or, as the case may be, the order striking out the defence. 
(7) the Court, if satisfied that the party was prevented by any sufficient cause from filing the true address at 
the proper time, shall set aside the order of stay or order striking out the defence, on such term as to costs or 
otherwise as it thinks fit and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit or defence, as the case may be. 
(8) Nothing in this rule shall prevent the Court from directing the service of a process at any other address, if, 
for any reason, it thinks fit to do so.]

     15. Verification of pleadings— (1) Save as otherwise provided by any law for the time being in force, every 
pleading shall be varied at the foot by the party or by one of the parties pleading or by some other person 
proved to the satisfaction of the Court to be acquainted with the facts of the case. 
(2) The person verifying shall specify, by reference to the numbered paragraphs of the pleading, what he 
verifies of his own knowledge and what he verifies upon information received and believed to be true. (3) The verification shall be signed by the person making it and shall state the date on which and the place at 
which it was signed. [135][16. Striking out pleadings— The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or 
amended any matter in any pleading— 
(a) which may be unnecessary, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, or 
(b) which may tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trail of the suit, or 
(c) which is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.] 
17. Amendment of pleadings— The Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or 
amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be 
made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. 
18. Failure to amend after order— If a party who has obtained an order for leave to amend does not amend 
accordingly within the time limited for that purpose by the order, or if no time is thereby limited then within 
fourteen days from the date of the order, he shall not be permitted to amend after the expiration of such 
limited time as aforesaid or of such fourteen days, as the case may be, unless the time is extended by the 
Court.

                   4. When plaintiff sues as representative— Where the plaintiff sues in a representative character the plaint

interested in subject-matter, and that he is liable to be called upon to answer the plaintiff's demand. 6. Grounds of exemption from limitation law— Where the suit is instituted after the expiration of the period 
prescribed by the law of limitation, the plaint shall show the ground upon which exemption from such law is 
claimed : 
[137] [Provided that the Court may permit the plaintiff to claim exemption from the law of limitation on any 
ground not set out in the plaint, if such ground is not inconsistent with the grounds set out in the plaint.] 7. Relief to be specifically stated— Every plaint shall state specifically the relief which the plaintiff claims 
either simply or in the alternative, and it shall not be necessary to ask for general or other relief which may 
always be given as the Court may think just to the same extent as if it had been asked for. And the same rule

[139] [(1A) The plaintiff shall, within the time fixed by the Court or extended by it under sub-rule (1), pay the

he finds them to be correct. [140][10. Return of plaint— (1) [141][Subject to the provisions of rule 10A, the plaint shall] at any state of the 
suit be returned to be presented to the Court in which the suit should have been instituted.

             (3) Where an application is made by the plaintiff under sub-rule (2), the Court shall, before returning the 
plaint and notwithstanding that the order for return of plaint was made by it on the ground that it has no 
jurisdiction to try the suit,—

and 
(b) give to the plaintiff and to the defendant notice of such date for appearance. 
(4) Where the notice of the date for appearance is given under sub-rule (3),— 
(a) it shall not be necessary for the Court in which the plaint is presented after its return, to serve the 
defendant with a summons for appearance in the suit, unless that Court, for reasons to be recorded 
otherwise directs, and 
(b) the said notice shall be deemed to be a summons for the appearance of the defendant in the Court in 
which the plaint is presented on the date so fixed by the Court by which the plaint was returned. (5) Where the application made by the plaintiff under sub-rule (2) is allowed by the Court, the plaintiff shall 
not be entitled to appeal against the order returning the plaint. 
10B. Power of appellate Court to transfer suit to the proper Court— (1) Where, on an appeal against an order 
for the return of plaint, the Court hearing the appeal confirms such order, the Court of appeal may, if the 
plaintiff by an application so desires, while returning the plaint, direct plaintiff to file the plaint, subject to the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), in the Court in which the suit should have been instituted, (whether such Court is within or without the State in which the Court hearing the appeal is situated), and fit a date for the appearance of the parties in the Court in which the plaint is directed to be filed and when the date is so fixed it shall not be necessary for the Court in which the plaint is filed to serve the defendant with the summons for appearance in the suit, unless that Court in which the plaint is filed, for reasons to be 
recorded, otherwise directs. 
(2) The direction made by the Court under sub-rule (1), shall be without any prejudice to the rights of the 
parties to question the jurisdiction of the Court, in which the plaint is filed, to try the suit.] 
11. Rejection of plaint— The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:— 
(a) where it does not disclose a cause of action; 
(b) where the relief claimed is undervalued, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the 
valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so; 
(c) where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the plaint is returned upon paper insufficiently stamped, 
and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed 
by the Court, fails to do so; 
(d) where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law : 
[144] [Provided that the time fixed by the Court for the correction of the valuation or supplying of the requisite 
stamp-paper shall not be extended unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded, is satisfied that the plaintiff 
was prevented by any cause of an exceptional nature form correcting the valuation or supplying the requisite 
stamp-paper , as the case may be, within the time fixed by the Court and that refusal to extend such time 
would cause grave injustice to the plaintiff.] 
12. Procedure on rejecting plaint— Where a plaint is rejected the Judge shall record an order to that effect 
with the reasons for such order. 
13. Where rejection of plaint does not preclude presentation of fresh plaint— The rejection of the plaint on 
any of the grounds herein before mentioned shall not of its own force preclude the plaintiff from presenting a 
fresh plaint in respect of the same cause of action. 
Documents relied on in plaint 14. Production of document on which plaintiff sues— (1) Where a plaintiff sues upon a document in his 
possession or power, he shall produce it in Court when the plaint is presented, and shall at the same time 
deliver the document or a copy thereof to be filed with the plaint.

        (2) List of other documents—Where he relies on any other documents (whether in his possession or power 
or not) as evidence in support of his claim, he shall enter such documents in a list to be added or annexed to 
the plaint. 
15. Statement in case of documents not in plaintiff's possession or power— Where any such document is not 
in the possession or power of the plaintiff, he shall, if possible, state in whose possession or power it is. 16. Suits on lost negotiable instruments— Where the suit is founded upon a negotiable instrument, and it is 
proved that the instrument is lost, and an indemnity is given by the plaintiff, to the satisfaction of the Court, 
against the claims of any other person upon such instrument, the Court may pass such decree as it would have passed if the plaintiff had produced the instrument in Court when the plaint was presented, and had at 
the same time delivered a copy of the instrument to be filed with the plaint. 
17. Production of shop-book— (1) Save in so far as is otherwise provided by the Bankers' Books Evidence 
Act, 1891 (18 of 1891), where the document on which the plaintiff sues is an entry in shop-book or other 
account in his possession or power the plaintiff shall produce the book or account at the time of filing the 
plaint, together with a copy of the entry on which he relies. 
(2) Original entry to be marked and returned—The Court, or such officer as it appoints in this behalf, shall 
forthwith mark the document for the purpose of identification, and, after examining and comparing the copy 
with the original, shall, if it is found correct, certify it to be so and return the book to the plaintiff and cause the 
copy to be filed. 
18. Inadmissibility of document not produced when plaint filed— (1) A document which ought to be produced 
in Court by the plaintiff when the plaint is presented, or to be entered in the list to be added or annexed to the 
plaint, and which is not produced or entered accordingly, shall not, without the leave of the Court, be received in evidence on his behalf at the hearing of the suit. 
(2) Nothing in this rule applies to documents produced for cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses or 
in answer to any case set up by the defendant or handed to a witness merely to refresh his memory ORDER VIII- [145][WRITTEN STATEMENT, SET-OF AND COUNTER- CLAIM] 1. Written statement— [146][(1)] The defendant [147]****shall, at or before the first hearing or within such 
time as the Court may permit, present a written statement of his defence. 
[148] [(2) Save as otherwise provided in rule 8A, where the defendant relies on any document (whether or 
not in his possession or power) in support of his defence or claim for set-off or counter claim, he shall enter 
such documents in a list, and shall, — 
(a) If a written statement is presented, annex the list to the written statement : 
Provided that where the defendant, in his written statement, claims a set-off or makes a counter-claim based 
on a document in his possession or power, he shall produce it in Court at the time of presentation of the written statement and shall at the same time deliver the document or copy thereof to be filed with the written 
statement; 
(b) If a written statement is not presented, present the list to the Court at the first hearing of the suit. 
(3) Where any such document is not in the possession or power of the defendant, he shall, wherever 
possible, state in whose possession or power it is. 
(4) If no such list is so annexed or presented, the defendant shall be allowed such further period for the 
purpose as the Court may think fit. (5) A document which ought to be entered in the list referred to in sub-rule (2), and which is not so entered, 
shall not, without the leave of the Court, be received in evidence on behalf of the defendant at the hearing of 
the suit. 
(6) Nothing in sub-rule (5) shall apply to documents produced for the cross-examination of plaintiff's 
witnesses or in answer to any case set up by the plaintiff subsequent to the filing of the plaint, or handed 
over to a witness merely to refresh his memory.

   (7) Where a Court grants leave under sub-rule (5), it shall record its reasons for so doing and no such leave 
shall be granted unless good cause is shown to the satisfaction of the Court for the non-entry of the 
document in the list referred to in sub-rule (2).] 
2. New facts must be specially pleaded— The defendant must raise by his pleading all matters which show 
the suit not be maintainable, or that the transaction is either void or voidable in point of law, and all such 
grounds of defence as, if not raised, would be likely to take the opposite party by surprise, or would raise issues of fact not arising out of the plaint, as, for instance, fraud, limitation, release, payment, performance, 
or facts showing illegality. 
3. Denial to be specific— It shall not be sufficient for a defendant in his written statement to deny generally 
the grounds alleged by the plaintiff, but the defendant must deal specifically with each allegation of fact of 
which he does not admit the truth, except damages. 
4. Evasive denial— Where a defendant denies an allegation of fact in the plaint, he must not do so evasively, 
but answer the point of substance, Thus, if it is alleged that he received a certain sum of money, it shall not 
be sufficient to deny that he received that particular amount, but he must deny that he received that sum or any part thereof, or else set out how much he received. And if an allegation is made with diverse circumstances, it shall not be sufficient to deny it along with those circumstances. 
5. Specific denial— [149][(1)] Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied specifically or by necessary 
implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the defendant, shall be taken to be admitted 
except as against a person under disability : 
Provided that the Court may in it discretion require any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than by such 
admission. 
[150] [(2) Where the defendant has not filed a pleading, it shall be lawful for the Court to pronounce judgment 
on the basis of the facts contained in the plaint, except as against a person under a disability, but the Court 
may, in its discretion, require any such fact to be proved. 
(3) In exercising its discretion under the proviso to sub-rule (1) or under sub-rule (2), the Court shall have 
due regard to the fact whether the defendant could have, or has, engaged a pleader. 
(4) Whenever a judgment is pronounced under this rule, a decree shall be drawn up in accordance with such 
judgment and such decree shall bear the date on which the judgment was pronounced.] 6. Particulars of set-off to be given in written statement— (1) Where in a suit for the recovery of money the 
defendant claims to set-off against the plaintiff's demand any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable 
by him from the plaintiff, not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Court, and both parties fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff's suit, the defendant may, at the first hearing of the suit, but not 
afterwards unless permitted by the Court, presents a written statement containing the particulars of the debt 
sought to be set-off. 
(2) Effect of set-off—The written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross-suit so as to 
enable the Court to pronounce a final judgment in respect both of the original claim and of the set-off : but 
this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs payable to him 
under the decree. 
(3) The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant apply to a written statement in answer to a claim 
of set-off. 
Illustrations 
(a) A bequeaths Rs. 2,000 to B and appoints C his executor and residuary legatee. B dies and D takes out 
administration to B's effect, C pays Rs. 1,000 as surety for D: then D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set-off 
the debt of Rs. 1,000 against the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the same character with respect to the 
legacy as they fill with respect to the payment of Rs. 1,000. 
(b) A dies intestate and in debt to B. C takes out administration to A's effects and B buys part of the effects 
from C. In a suit for the purchase-money by C against B, the latter cannot set-off the debt against the price, 
for C fills two different characters, one as the vendor to B, in which he sues B, and the other as 
representative to A.

                   (c) A sues B on a bill of exchange. B alleges that A has wrongfully neglected to insure B's goods and is liable 
to him in compensation which he claims to set-off. The amount not being ascertained cannot be set-off. (d) A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs. 500. B holds a judgment against A for Rs. 1,000. The two claims 
being both definite, pecuniary demands may be set-off. (e) A sues B for compensation on account of trespass. B holds a promissory note for Rs. 1,000 from A and 
claims to set-off that amount against any sum that A may recover in the suit. B may do so, for as soon as A 
recovers, both sums are definite pecuniary demands. 
(f) A and B sue C for Rs. 1,000 C cannot set-off a debt due to him by A alone. 
(g) A sues B and C for Rs. 1000. B cannot set-off a debt due to him alone by A. 
(h) A owes the partnership firm of B and C Rs. 1,000 B dies, leaving C surviving. A sues C for a debt of Rs. 
1,500 due in his separate character. C may set-off the debt of Rs. 1,000. [151][6A. Counter-claim by defendant— (1) A defendant in a suit may, in addition to his right of pleading a 
set-off under rule 6, set up, by way of counter-claim against the claim of the plaintiff, any right or claim in 
respect of a cause of action accruing to the defendant against the plaintiff either before or after the filing of the suit but before the defendant has delivered his defence or before the time limited for delivering his 
defence has expired. whether such counter-claim is in the nature of a claim for damages or not : 
Provided that such counter-claim shall not exceed the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. (2) Such counter-claim shall have the same effect as a cross-suit so as to enable the Court to pronounce a 
final judgment in the same suit, both on the original claim and on the counter-claim. (3) The plaintiff shall be at liberty to file a written statement in answer to the counter-claim of the defendant 
within such period as may be fixed by the Court. (4) The counter-claim shall be treated as a plaint and governed by the rules applicable to plaints. 
6B. Counter-claim to be stated— Where any defendant seeks to rely upon any ground as supporting a right 
of counter-claim, he shall, in his written statement, state specifically that he does so by way of counter-claim. 
6C. Exclusion of counter-claim— Where a defendant sets up a counter-claim and the plaintiff contends that 
the claim thereby raised ought not to be disposed of by way of counter-claim but in an independent suit, the plaintiff may, at any time before issues are settled in relation to the counter-claim, apply to the Court for an order that such counter-claim may be excluded, and the Court may, on the hearing of such application make 
such order as it thinks fit. 
6D. Effect of discontinuance of suit— If in any case in which the defendant sets up a counter-claim, the suit 
of the plaintiff is stayed, discontinued or dismissed, the counter-claim may nevertheless be proceeded with. 
6E. Default of plaintiff to reply to counter-claim— If the plaintiff makes default in putting in reply to the 
counter-claim made by the defendant, the Court may pronounce judgment against the plaintiff in relation to 
the counter-claim made against him or make such order in relation to the counter-claim as it thinks fit. 
6F. Relief to defendant where counter-claim succeeds— Where in any suit a set-off or counter-claim is 
established as defence against the plaintiff's claim and any balance is found due to the plaintiff or the 
defendant, as the case may be, the Court may give judgment to the party entitled to such balance. 
6G. Rules relating to written statement to apply— The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant 
shall apply to a written statement filed in answer to a counter-claim.] 
7. Defence or set-off founder upon separate grounds— Where the defendant relies upon several distinct 
grounds of defence or set-off [152][or counter-claim] founded separate and distinct facts, they shall be 
stated, as far as may be, separately and distinctly. 
8. New ground of defence— Any ground of defence which has arisen after the institution of the suit or the 
presentation of a written statement claiming a set-off [153][or counter-claim] may be raised by the defendant 
or plaintiff as the case may be, in his written statement. 
[154][8A. Duty of defendant to produce documents upon which relief is claimed by him— (1)Where a 
defendant bases his defence upon a document in his possession or power, he shall produce it in Court when

                   the written statement is presented by him and shall, at the same time, deliver the document or a copy 
thereof, to be filed with the written statement. 
(2) A document which ought to be produced in Court by the defendant under this rule, but is not so produced, 
shall not, without the leave of the Court, be received in evidence on his behalf at the hearing of the suit. 
(3) Nothing in this rule shall apply to documents produced,— 
(a) for the cross-examination of the plaintiff's witnesses, or 
(b) in answer to any case setup by the plaintiff subsequent to the filing of the plaint, or 
(c) handed over to a witness merely to refresh him memory]. 
9. Subsequent pleadings— No pleading subsequent to the written statement of a defendant other than by 
way of defence to a set-off [155][or counter-claim] shall be presented except by the leave of the Court and 
upon such terms as the Court thinks fit, but the Court may at any time require a written statement or 
additional written statement from any of the parties and fix a time for presenting the same. 
10. Procedure when party fails to present written statement called for by Court— Where any party from 
whom a written statement [156][is required under rule 1 or 9] fails to present the same within the time 
[157][permitted or fixed by the Court, as the case may be, the Court shall] pronounce judgment against him 
or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit [158][and on the pronouncement of such judgment, a 
decree shall be drawn up.] 
ORDER IX- APPEARANCE OF PARTIES AND CONSEQUENCE OF NON-APPEARANCE 1. Parties to appear on day fixed in summons for defendant to appear and answer— On the day fixed in the 
summons for the defendant to appear and answer, the parties shall be in attendance at the Court-house in 
person or by their respective pleaders, and the suit shall then be heard unless the hearing is adjourned to a future day fixed by the Court. 
2. Dismissal of suit where summons not served in consequence of plaintiffs failure to pay cost— Where on 
the day so fixed it is found that the summons has not been served upon the defendant in consequence of the 
failure of the plaintiff to pay the court-fee of postal charges (if any) chargeable for such service, [159][or to present copies of the plaint or concise statements, as required by rule 9 of order VII,] the Court may make an 
order that the suit be dismissed : 
[160] [Provided that no such order shall be made, if, notwithstanding such failure the defendant attends in 
person (or by agent when he is allowed to appear by agent) on the day fixed for him to appear and answer.] 3. Where neither party appears, suit to be dismissed— Where neither party appears when the suit is called 
on for hearing, the Court may make an order that the suit be dismissed. 
4. Plaintiff may bring fresh suit or Court may restore suit to file— Where a suit is dismissed under rule 2 or 
rule 3, the plaintiff may (subject to the law of limitation) bring a fresh suit, or he may apply for an order to set 
the dismissal aside, and if he satisfies the Court that there was sufficient cause for [161][such failure as is referred to in rule 2], or for his non-appearance, as the case may be, the Court shall make an order setting 
aside the dismissal and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit. 
5. Dismissal of suit where plaintiff after summons returned unserved, fails for one month to apply for fresh 
summons— (1) Where after a summons has been issued to the defendant, or to one of several defendants, 
and returned unserved the plaintiff fails, for a periods of [162][one month] from the date of the return made to the Court by the officer ordinarily certifying to the Court returns made by the serving officers, to apply for the issue of a fresh summons the Court shall make an order that the suit be dismissed as against such 
defendant, unless the plaintiff has within the said period satisfied the Court that— 
(a) he has failed after using his best endeavours to discover the residence of the defendant, who has not 
been served, or 
(b) such defendant is avoiding service of process, or

suit so far as it relates to the remainder.

plaintiffs than one, and one or more of them appear, and the others do not appear, the Court may, at the 
instance of the plaintiff or plaintiffs appearing, permit the suit to proceed in the same way as if all the plaintiffs 
had appeared, or make such order as it thinks fit. 
11. Procedure in case of non-attendance of one or more of several defendants— Where there are more 
defendants than one, and one or more of them appear, and the others do not appear, the suit shall proceed, 
and the Court shall, at the time of pronouncing judgment, make such order as it thinks fit with respect to the 
defendants who do not appear. 
12. Consequence of non-attendance, without sufficient cause shown, of party ordered to appear in person— 
Where a plaintiff or defendant, who has been ordered to appear in person, does not appear in person, or

thinks fit, and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit; 
Provided that where the decree is of such a nature that it cannot be set aside as against such defendant only 
it may be set aside as against all or any of the other defendants also: 
[164] [Provided further that no Court shall set aside a decree passed ex parte merely on the ground that 
there has been an irregularity in the service of summons, if it is satisfied that the defendant had notice of the 
date of hearing and had sufficient time to appear and answer the plaintiff's claim] 
[165] [Explanation.—Where there has been an appeal against a decree passed ex parte under this rule, and 
the appeal has been disposed of an any ground other than the ground that the appellant has withdrawn the 
appeal, no application shall lie under this rule for setting aside that ex parte decree.]

application as aforesaid unless notice thereof has been served on the opposite party. ORDER X-EXAMINATION OF PARTIES BY THE COURT

such admissions and denials.

party appearing in person or present in Court or his pleader is accompanied. (2) At any subsequent hearing, the Court may orally examine any party appearing in person or present in 
Court, or any person, able to answer any material question relating to the suit, by whom such party or his 
pleader is accompanied.

either party.] 
3. Substance of examination to be written— The substance of the examination shall be reduced to writing by 
the Judge, and shall form part of the record. 4. Consequence of refusal or inability of pleader to answer— (1) Where the pleader of any party who 
appears by a pleader or any such person accompanying a pleader as is referred to in rule 2, refuses or is 
unable to answer any material question relating to the suit which the Court is of opinion that the party whom 
he represents ought to answer, and is likely to be able to answer if interrogated in person, the Court may postpone the hearing of the suit to a future day and direct that such party shall appear in person on such 
day. 
(2) If such party fails without lawful excuse to appear in person on the day so appointed, the Court may 
pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. ORDER XI-DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

person, any opposite party may apply for an order allowing him to deliver interrogatories to any member or 
officer of such corporation or body, and an order may be made accordingly. 
6. Objections to interrogatories by answer— Any objection to answering any interrogatory on the ground that 
it is scandalous or irrelevant or not exhibited bona fide for the purpose of the suit, or that the matters inquired 
into are not sufficiently material at that stage, [167][or on the ground of privilege or any other ground], may be taken in the affidavit in answer. 
7. Setting aside and striking out interrogatories— Any interrogatories may be set aside on the ground that

document [168][or who has entered any document in any list annexed to his pleadings] or produce such document for the inspection of the party giving such notice, or of his pleader, and to permit him or them to take copies thereof; and any party not complying with such notice shall not afterwards be at liberty to put any such document in evidence on his behalf in such suit unless he shall satisfy the Court that such document 
relates only to his own title, he being a defendant to the suit, or that he had some other cause or excuse with 
the Court shall deem sufficient for not complying with such notice, in which case the Court may allow the 
same to be put in evidence on such terms as to costs an otherwise as the Court shall think fit. 
16. Notice to produce— Notice to any party to produce any documents referred to in his pleading or affidavits 
shall be in Form No. 7 in Appendix C, with such variations as circumstances may require.

from the receipt of such notice, deliver to the party giving the same a notice stating a time within three days 
from the delivery thereof at which the documents, or such of them as he does not object to produce, may be inspected at the office of his pleader, or in the case of bankers books or other books of account or books in constant use for the purposes of any trade or business, at their usual place of custody, and stating which (if any) of the documents he objects to produce, and on what ground.

Appendix C, with such variations as circumstances may require. 
18. Order for inspection— (1) Where the party served with notice under rule 15 omits to give such notice of a 
time for inspection or objects to give inspection, or offers inspection elsewhere than at the office of his 
pleader, the Court may, on the application of the party desiring it, make an order for inspection in such place 
and in such manner as it may think fit : 
Provided that the order shall not be made when and so far as the Court shall be of opinion that, it is not 
necessary either for disposing fairly of the suit or for saving costs. 
(2) Any application to inspect documents, except such as are referred to in the pleadings, particulars or 
affidavits of the party against whom the application is made or disclosed in his affidavit of documents, shall 
be founded upon an affidavit showing of what documents inspection is sought, that the party applying is entitled to inspect them, and that they are in the possession or power of the other party. The Court shall not make such order for inspection of such documents when and so far as the Court shall be of opinion that it is 
not necessary either for disposing fairly of the suit or for saving costs. 
19. Verified copies— (1) Where inspection of any business books is applied for, the Court may , if it thinks fit, 
instead of ordering inspection of the original books, order a copy of any entries therein to be furnished and 
verified by the affidavit of some person who has examined the copy with the original entries, and such affidavit shall state whether or not there are in the original book any and what erasures, interlineations or 
alterations : 
Provided that, notwithstanding that such copy has been supplied, the Court may order inspection of the book 
from which the copy was made. 
(2) Where on an application for an order for inspection privilege is claimed for any document, it shall be 
lawful for the Court to inspect the document for the purpose of deciding as to the validity of the claim of 
privilege [169][unless the document relates to matters of State.] 
(3) The Court may, on the application of any party to a suit at any time, and whether an affidavit of 
documents shall or shall not have already been ordered or made, make an order requiring any other party to 
state by affidavit whether anyone or more specific documents, to be specified in the application, is or are, or 
has or have at an time been, in his possession or power, and , if not then in his possession, when he parted 
with the same and what has become thereof. Such application shall be made on an affidavit stating that in the belief of the deponent the party against whom the application is made has, or has at some time and, in his possession or power the document or documents specified in the application, and that they relate to the 
matters in questions in the suit, or to some of them. 
20. Premature discovery— Where the party from whom discovery of any kind or inspection is sought objects 
to the same, or any part thereof, the Court may if satisfied that the right to the discovery or inspection sought

admit such document. 
4. Notice to admit acts— Any party, may, by notice in writing, at any time not later than nine days before the

unless the Court otherwise directs: 
Provided that any admission made in pursuance of such notice is to be deemed to be made only for the 
purposes of the particular suit, and not as an admission to be used against the party on any other occasion

ORDER XIV-SETTLEMENT OF ISSUES AND DETERMINATION OF SUIT ON ISSUES OF LAW OR ON 
ISSUES AGREED UPON 
1. Framing of issues— (1) Issues arise when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by the one party 
and denied by the other. 
(2) Material propositions are those propositions of law or fact which a plaintiff must allege in order to show a 
right to sue or a defendant must allege in order to constitute his defence. (3) Each material proposition affirmed by one party denied by the other shall form the subject of distinct 
issue. 
(4) Issues are of two kinds : 
(a) issues of fact, 
(b) issues of law. 
(5) At the first hearing of the suit the Court shall, after reading the plaint and the written statements, if any, 
and [181][after examination under rule 2 of Order X and after hearing the parties or their pleaders], ascertain 
upon what material propositions of fact or of law the parties are at variance, and shall thereupon proceed to frame and record the issues on which the right decision of the case appears to depend. 
(6) Nothing in this rule requires the Court to frame and record issues where the defendant at the first hearing 
of the suit makes no defence. 
[182][2. Court to pronounce judgment on all issues— (1) Notwithstanding that a case may be disposed of on 
preliminary issue, the Court shall, subject to the provisions of sub-rule (2), pronounce judgment on all issues. 
(2) Where issues both of law and of fact arise in the same suit, and the Court is of opinion that the case or 
any part thereof may be disposed of on an issue of law only, it may try that issue first if that issue relates to— 
(a) the jurisdiction of the Court, or 
(b) a bar to the suit created by any law for the time being inforce. 
and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit, postpone the settlement of the other issues until after that issue has 
been determined, and may deal with the suit in accordance with the decision on that issue.] 
3. Materials from which issues may be framed— The Court may frame the issues from all or any of the 
following materials :— (a) allegations made on oath by the parties, or by any persons present on their behalf, or made by the 
pleaders of such parties; 
(b) allegations made in the pleadings or in answers to interrogatories delivered in the suit; 
(c) the contents of documents by either party. 
4. Court may examine witnesses or documents before framing issues— Where the Court is of opinion that 
the issues cannot be correctly framed without the examination of some person not before the Court or

     without the inspection of some document not produced in the suit, it may adjourn the framing of the issues to 
a future day, and may (subject to any law for the time being in force) compel the attendance of any person or the production of any document by the person in whose possession or power it is by summons or other 
process. 
5. Power to amend and strike out, issues— (1) The Court may at any time before passing a decree amend 
the issues or frame additional issues on such terms as it thinks fit, and all such amendments or additional 
issues as may be necessary for determining the matters in controversy between the parties shall be so made 
or framed. 
(2) The Court may also, at any time before passing a decree, strike out any issues that appear to it to be 
wrongly framed or introduced. 6. Questions of fact or law may by agreement be stated in form of issues— Where the parties to a suit are 
agreed as to the question of fact or of law to be decided between them, they may state the same in the form 
of an issue, and enter into an agreement in writing that upon the finding of the Court in the affirmative or the 
negative of such issue,— 
(a) a sum of money specified in the agreement or to be ascertained by the Court, or in such manner as the 
Court may direct, shall be paid by one of the parties to the other of them, or that one of them be declared 
entitled to some right or subject some liability specified in the agreement; 
(b) some property specified in the agreement and in dispute in the suit shall be delivered by one of the 
parties to the other of them, or as that other may direct; or (c) one or more of the parties shall do or abstain from doing some particular act specified in the agreement 
and relating to the matter in dispute. 7. Court, if satisfied that agreement was executed in good faith, may pronounce judgment— Where the Court 
is satisfied, after making such inquiry as it deems proper,— 
(a) that the agreement was duly executed by the parties;

defendant in that behalf provided such representation is made within 10 days of the first hearing or, of the 
expiry of the week referred to in sub-section (1), as the case may be.

Provided further that if the amount deposited includes any sums claimed by the depositor to be deductible on 
any account, the Court may require the plaintiff to furnish the security for such sum before he is allowed to

STATE AMENDMENTS 
Uttar Pradesh.— In its application to the State of Uttar Pradesh, in Order XVI, rule 4, add the following 
proviso:— 
"Provided that nothing in this rule shall apply to a case where the witness is a Government servant 
summoned at the instance of Government as a party. 
[U.P. Act., 57 of 1976]. 
5. Time, place and purpose of attendance to be specified in summons— Every summons for the attendance 
of a person to give evidence or to produce a document shall specify the time and place at which he is 
required to attend, and also whether his attendance is required for the purpose of giving evidence or to produce a document, or for both purposes; and any particular document, which the person summoned is 
called on to produce, shall be described in the summons with reasonable accuracy. 
6. Summons to produce document— Any person may be summoned to produce a document, without being 
summoned to give evidence, and any person summoned merely to produce a document shall be deemed to 
have complied with the summons if he causes such document to be produced instead of attending 
personally to produce the same. 
7. Power to require persons present in Court to give evidence or produce document— Any person present in 
Court may be required by the Court to give evidence or to produce any document then and there in his 
possession or power. 
[188][7A. Summons given to party for service— (1) The Court may, on the application of any party for the 
issue of a summons for the attendance of any person, permit such party to effect service of such summons 
on such person and shall, in such a case, deliver the summons to such party for service. 
(2) The service of such summons shall be effected by or on behalf of such party by delivering or tendering to 
the witness personally a copy thereof signed by the Judge or such officer of the Court as he may appoint in 
this behalf and sealed with the seal of the Court. 
(3) The provisions of rules 16 and 18 of Order V shall apply to a summons personally served under this rule 
as if the person effecting service were a serving officer. (4) If such summons, when tendered, is refused or if the person served refuses to sign and 
acknowledgement of service or for any reason such summons cannot be served personally, the Court shall, 
on the application of the party, re-issue such summons to be served by the Court in the same manner as a 
summons to a defendant. 
(5) Where a summons is served by a party under this rule, the party shall not be required to pay the fees 
otherwise chargeable for the service of summons.] 8. Summons how served— Every summons [189][under this Order, not being a summons delivered to a 
party for service under rule 7A,] shall be served as nearly as may be in the same manner as a summons to a 
defendant and the rules in Order V as to proof of service shall apply in the case of all summonses served 
under this rule. 
9. Time for serving summons— Service shall in all cases be made a sufficient time before the time specified 
in the summons for the attendance of the person summoned, to allow him a reasonable time for preparation 
and for travelling to the place at which his attendance is required.

                     10. Procedure whose witness fails to comply with summons— [190][(1) Where a person to whom a 
summons has been issued either to attend to give evidence or to produce a document, fails to attend or to 
produce the document in compliance with such summons, the Court— 
(a) shall, if the certificate of the serving officer has not been verified by affidavit, or if service of the summons 
has been effected by a party or his agent, or 
(b) may, if the certificate of the serving officer has been so verified. 
examine on oath the serving officer or the party or his agent, as the case may be, who has effected service, 
or cause him to be so examined by any Court, touching the service or non-service of the summons.] 
(2) Where the Court sees reason to believe that such evidence or production is material, and that such 
person has, without lawful excuse, failed to attend or to produce the document in compliance with such 
summons or has intentionally avoided service, it may issue a proclamation requiring him to attend to give evidence or to produce the document at a time and place to be named therein; and a copy of such proclamation shall be affixed on the outer door or other conspicuous part of the house in which he ordinarily 
resides. 
(3) In view of or at the time of issuing such proclamation, or at any time afterwards, the Court may, in its 
discretion, issue a warrant, either with or without bail, for the arrest of such person, and may make an order 
for the attachment of his property to such amount as it thinks fit, not exceeding the amount of the costs of 
attachment and of any fine which may be imposed under rule 12 : 
Provided that no Court of Small Causes shall make an order for the attachment of immovable property. 
11. If witness appears attachment may be withdrawn— Where at any time after the attachment of his 
property, such person appears and satisfies the Court— 
(a) that he did not, without lawful excuse, fail to comply with the summons or intentionally avoid service, and 
(b) where he has failed to attend at the time and place named in a proclamation issued under the last 
proceeding rule, that he had no notice of such proclamation in time to attend. 
the Court shall direct that the property be released from attachment, and shall make such order as to the 
costs of the attachment as it thinks fit. 
12. Procedure if witness fails to appear— [191][(1)] The Court may, where such person does not appear, or 
appears but fails so to satisfy the Court, impose upon him such fine not exceeding five hundred rupees as it 
thinks fit, having regard to his condition in life and all the circumstances of the case, and may order his property, or any part thereof, to the attached and sold or, if already attached under rule 10, to be sold for the 
purpose of satisfying all costs to such attachment, together with the amount of the said fine, if any: 
Provided that, if the person whose attendance is required pays into Court the Costs and fine aforesaid, the 
Court shall order the property to be released from attachment. 
[192] [(2) Notwithstanding that the Court has not issued a proclamation under sub-rule (2) of rule 10, nor 
issued a warrant nor ordered attachment under sub-rule (3) of that rule, the Court may impose fine under 
sub- rule (1) of this rule after giving notice to such person to show cause why the fine should not be 
imposed.] 
13. Mode of attachment.—The provisions with regard to the attachment and sale of property in the execution 
of a decree shall, so far as they are applicable, be deemed to apply to any attachment and sale under this 
Order as if the person whose property is so attached were a judgment-debtor. 
14. Court may of its own accord summon as witnesses strangers to suit.— Subject to the provisions of this 
Code as to attendance and appearance and to any law for the time being in force, where the Court at any 
time thinks it necessary [193][to examine any person, including a party to the suit] and not called as witness by a party to the suit, the Court may, of its own motion, cause such person to be summoned as a witness to give evidence, or to produce any document in his possession on a day to be appointed, and may examine 
him as a witness or require him to produce such document. 
15. Duty of persons summoned give evidence or produce document— Subject as last aforesaid, whoever is 
summoned to appear and give evidence in a suit shall attend at the time an place named in the summons for

to be produced, at such time and place. 
16. When they may depart— (1) A person so summoned and attending shall, unless the Court otherwise 
directs, attend at each hearing until the suit has been disposed of. (2) On the application of either party and the payment through the Court of all necessary expenses (if any), 
the Court may require any person so summoned and attending to furnish security to attend at the next or any

Judge may so take it down or cause it to be taken down. 
(2) Where evidence is not given in English but all the parties who appear in person, and the pleaders of such

Provided that, in the case of a decree for the payment of money, the value of the property attached shall, as 
nearly as may be, correspond with the amount due under the decree.

the Court has ordered execution to issue against him. 
(2) Nothing in the foregoing sub-rule shall be deemed to preclude the Court from issuing any process in 
execution of a decree without issuing the notice thereby prescribed, if, for reasons to be recorded, it 
considers that the issue of such notice would cause unreasonable delay or would defeat the ends of justice. 
[253][22A . Sale not to be set aside on the death of the judgment-debtor before the sale but after the service 
of the proclamation of sale.— Where any property is sold in execution of a decree, the sale shall not be set aside merely by reason of the death of the judgment-debtor between the date of issue of the proclamation of sale and the date of the sale notwithstanding the failure of the decree-holder to substitute the legal 
representative of such deceased judgment-debtor, but, in case of such failure, the Court may set aside the 
sale if it is satisfied that the legal representative of the deceased judgment-debtor has been prejudiced by the 
sale.] 
23 . Procedure after issue of notice— (1) Where the person to whom notice is issued under [254][rule 22] 
does not appear or does not show cause to the satisfaction of the Court why the decree should not be

such officer as the Court may appoint in this behalf, and shall be sealed with the seal of the Court and 
delivered to the proper officer to be executed. 
[255] [(3)] In every such process, a day shall be specified on or before which it shall be executed and a day 
shall also be specified on or before which it shall be returned to the Court, but no process shall be deemed to 
be void if no day for its return is specified therein.] 
25 . Endorsement on process— (1) The officer entrusted with the execution of the process shall endorse 
thereon the day on, and the manner in which it was executed, and, if the latest day specified in the process 
for the return thereof has been exceeded, the reason of the delay, or, if it is executed, the reason why it was 
not executed, and shall return the process with such endorsement to the Court. 
(2) Where the endorsement is to the effect that such officer is unable to execute the process, the Court shall 
examine him touching his alleged inability, and may, if it thinks fit, summon and examine witnesses as to 
such inability, and shall record the result. 
Stay of execution 
26 . When Court may stay execution— (1) the Court to which a decree has been sent for execution shall, 
upon sufficient cause being shown, stay the execution of such decree for a reasonable time, to enable the 
judgment-debtor to apply to the Court by which the decree was passed, or to any Court having appellate 
jurisdiction in respect of the decree or the execution thereof, for an order to stay execution, or for any other order relating to the decree or execution which might have been made by such Court of first instance or 
Appellate Court if execution had been issued thereby, or if application for execution had been made thereto. 
(2) Where the property or person of the judgment-debtor has been seized under an execution, the Court 
which issued the execution may order the restitution of such property or the discharge of such person 
pending the result of the application.

any Court against the holder of a decree of such Court [257] [or of a decree which is being executed by such Court], on the part of the person against whom the decree was passed, the Court may, on such terms as to 
security or otherwise, as it thinks fit, stay execution of the decree until the pending suit has been decided : 
[258] [Provided that if the decree is one for payment of money, the Court shall, if it grants stay without 
requiring security, record its reasons for so doing.] 
Mode of execution 
30 . Decree for payment of money— Every decree for the payment of money, including a decree for the 
payment of money as the alternative to some other relief, may be executed by the detention in the civil prison

execution-proceedings.

Court may, on the application of the decree-holder and without prejudice to its power under sub-rule (1), by 
order require the judgment-debtor or where the judgment-debtor is a corporation, any officer thereof, to make 
an affidavit stating the particulars of the assets of the judgment-debtor. 
(3) In case of disobedience of any order made under sub-rule (2), the Court making the order, or any Court 
to which the proceeding is transferred, may direct that the person disobeying the order be detained in the 
civil prison for a term not exceeding three months unless before the expiry of such term the Court directs his 
release.] 
42 . Attachment in case of decree for rent or mesne profits or other matter, amount of which to be 
subsequently determined— Where a decree directs an inquiry as to rent or mesne profits or any other matter, the property of the judgment-debtor may, before the amount due from him has been ascertained, be 
attached, as in the case of an ordinary decree for the payment of money. 
43 . Attachment of movable property, other than agricultural produce, in possession of judgment-debtor— 
Where the property to be attached is movable property, other than agricultural produce, in the possession of the judgment-debtor, the attachment shall be made by actual seizure, and the attaching officer shall keep the property in his own custody or in the custody of one of his subordinates, and shall be responsible for the due 
custody thereof: 
Provided that, when the property seized is subject to speedy and natural decay, or when the expense of 
keeping it in custody is likely to exceed its value, the attaching officer may sell it at once.

        [267][43A . Custody of movable property— (1) Where the property attached consists of live-stock, 
agricultural implements or other articles which cannot conveniently be removed and the attaching officer does not act under the proviso to rule 43, he may, at the instance of the judgment-debtor or of the decree-holder or of any other person claiming to be interested in such property, leave it in the village or place where 
it has been attached, in the custody of any respectable person (hereinafter referred to as the "custodian"). 
(2) If the custodian fails, after due notice, to produce such property at the place named by the Court before 
the officer deputed for the purpose or to restore it to the person in whose favour restoration is ordered by the 
Court, or if the property, though so produced or restored, is not in the same condition as it was when it was 
entrusted to him,— 
(a) the custodian shall be liable to pay compensation to the decree-holder, judgment-debtor or any other 
person who is found to be entitled to the restoration thereof, for any loss or damage cause by his default; and 
(b) such liability may be enforced— 
(i) at the instance of the decree-holder, as if the custodian were a surety under section 145; 
(ii) at the instance of the judgment-debtor or such other person, on an application in execution; and 
(c) any order determining such liability shall be appealable as a decree.] 
44 . Attachment of agricultural produce— Where the property to be attached is agricultural produce, the 
attachment shall be made by affixing a copy of the warrant of attachment,— 
(a) where such produce is a growing crop, on the land on which such crop has grown, or 
(b) where such produce has been cut or gathered, on the threshing floor or place for treading out grain or the 
like or fodder-stack on or in which it is deposited, 
and another copy on the outer door or on some other conspicuous part of the house in which the judgment-
debtor ordinarily resides or, with the leave of the Court, on the outer door or on some other conspicuous part of the house in which he carries on business or personally works for gain or in which he is known to have last 
resided or carried on business or personally worked for gain; and the produce shall thereupon be deemed to 
have passed into the possession of the Court. 
45 . Provisions as to agricultural produce under attachment— (1) Where agricultural produce is attached, the 
Court shall make such arrangements for the custody thereof as it may deem sufficient and, for the purpose of 
enabling the Court to make such arrangements, every application for the attachment of a growing crop shall 
specify the time at which it is likely to be fit to be cut or gathered. 
(2) Subject to such conditions as may be imposed by the Court in this behalf either in the order of attachment 
or in any subsequent order, the judgment-debtor may tend, cut, gather and store the produce and do any 
other act necessary for maturing or preserving it; and if the judgment-debtor fails to do all or any of such acts, the decree-holder may, with the permission of the Court and subject to the like conditions, do all or any of them either by himself or by any person appointed by him in this behalf and the costs incurred by the decree-holder shall be recoverable from the judgment-debtor as if they were included in, or formed part of, 
the decree. 
(3) Agricultural produce attached as a growing crop shall not be deemed to have ceased to be under 
attachment or to require re-attachment merely because it has been severed from the soil. (4) Where an order for the attachment of a growing crop has been made at a considerable time before the 
crop is likely to be fit to be cut or gathered, the Court may suspend the execution of the order for such time 
as it thinks fit, and may, in its discretion, make a further order prohibiting the removal of the crop pending the 
execution of the order of attachment. 
(5) A growing crop which from its nature does not admit of being stored shall not be attached under the rule 
at any time less than twenty days before the time at which it is likely to be fit to be cut or gathered. 46. Attachment of debt, share and other property not in possession of Judgment-debtor — (1) In the case 
of— 
(a) a debt not secured by a negotiable instrument,

         (b) a share in the capital of a corporation, 
(c) other movable property not in the possession of the judgment- debtor, except property deposited in, or in 
the custody of, any Court, the attachment shall be made by a written order prohibiting,— 
(i) in the case of the debt, the credit or from recovering the debt and the debtor from making payment thereof 
until the further order of the Court; (ii) in the case of the share, the person in whose name the share may be standing from transferring the same 
or receiving any dividend thereon; 
(iii) in the case of the other movable property except as aforesaid, the person in possession of the same from 
giving it over to the judgment-debtor. (2) A copy of such order shall be affixed on some conspicuous part of the court-house, and another copy 
shall be sent in the case of the debt, to the debtor, in the case of the share, to the proper officer of the 
corporation and, in the case of the other movable property (except as aforesaid), to the person in possession 
of the same. 
(3) A debtor prohibited under clause (i) of sub-rule (1) may pay the amount of his debt into Court, and such 
payment shall discharge him as effectually as payment to the party entitled to receive the same. [268][46A . Notice to garnishee— (1) The Court may in the case of a debt (other than a debt secured by a 
mortgage or a charge) which has been attached under rule 46, upon the application of the attaching creditor, 
issue notice to the garnishee liable to pay such debt, calling upon him either to pay into Court the debt due 
from him to the judgment-debtor or so much thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the decree and costs of 
execution, or to appear and show cause why he should not do so. 
(2) An application under sub-rule (l) shall be made on affidavit verifying the facts alleged and stating that in 
the belief of the deponent, the garnishee is indebted to the judgment-debtor. (3) Where the garnishee pays in the Court the amount due from him to the judgment-debtor or so much 
thereof as is sufficient to satisfy the decree and the costs of the execution, the Court may direct that the 
amount may be paid to the decree-holder towards satisfaction of the decree and costs of the execution. 
46B . Order against garnishee— Where the garnishee does not forthwith pay into Court the amount due from 
him to the judgment-debtor or so much thereof as is sufficient to satisfy the decree and the costs of execution, and does not appear and show cause in answer to the notice, the Court may order the garnishee to comply with the terms of such notice, and on such order, execution may issue as though such order were 
a decree against him. 
46C . Trial of disputed questions— Where the garnishee disputes liability, the Court may order that any issue 
or question necessary for the determination of liability shall be tried as if it were an issue in a suit, and upon 
the determination of such issue shall make such order or orders as it deems fit: 
Provided that if the debt in respect of which the application under rule 46A is made is in respect of a sum of 
money beyond the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court, the Court shall send the execution case to the Court of the District Judge to which the said Court is subordinate, and thereupon the Court of the District Judge or any other competent Court to which it may be transferred by the District Judge shall deal with it in the same 
manner as if the case had been originally instituted in that Court. 
46D . Procedure where debt belongs to third person— Where it is suggested or appears to be probable that 
the debt belongs to some third person, or that any third person has a lien or charge on, or other interest in such debt, the Court may order such third person to appear and state the nature and particulars of his claim, 
if any, to such debt and prove the same. 
46E . Order as regards third person— After hearing such third person and any person or persons who any 
subsequently be ordered to appear, or where such third or other person or persons do not appear when so ordered, the Court may make such order as is hereinbefore provided, or such other order or orders upon such terms, if any, with respect to the lien, charge or interest, as the case may be, of such third or other 
person or persons as it may deem fit and proper.

    46F . Payment by garnishee to be valid discharge— Payment made by the garnishee on notice under rule 
46A or under any such order as aforesaid shall be a valid discharge to him as against the judgment-debtor and any other person ordered to appear as aforesaid for the amount paid or levied, although the decree in execution of which the application under rule 46A was made, or the order passed in the proceedings on such 
application may be set aside or reversed. 
46G . Costs— The costs of any application made under rule 46A and of any proceeding arising therefrom or 
incidental thereto shall be in the discretion of the Court. 
46H . Appeals— An order made under rule 46B, rule 46C or rule 46E shall be appealable as a decree. 
46I . Application to negotiable instruments— The provisions of rule 46A to 46H (both inclusive) shall, so far 
as may be, apply in relation to negotiable instruments attached under rule 51 as they apply in relation to 
debts.] 
47 . Attachment of share in movables— Where the property to be attached consists of the share or interest 
of the judgment-debtor in movable property belonging to him and another as co-owners, the attachment shall be made by a notice to the judgment-debtor prohibiting him from transferring the share or interest or charging 
it in any way. 
48 . Attachment of salary or allowances of servant of the Government or railway company or local authority— 
(1) Where the property to be attached is the salary or allowances of a servant of the Government or of a 
servant of a railway company or local authority [269][or of a servant of a corporation engaged in any trade or industry which is established by a Central, Provincial or State Act, or a Government company as defined in section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956)] the Court, whether the judgment-debtor or the disbursing officer is or is not within the local limits of the Court's jurisdiction, may order that the amount shall, 
subject to the provisions of section 60, be withheld from such salary or allowances either in one payment or 
by monthly instalments as the Court may direct; and, upon notice of the order to such officer as the 
appropriate Government may be notification in the Official Gazette appoint in this behalf,— 
(a) where such salary or allowances are to be disbursed within the local limits to which this Code for the time 
being extends, the officer or other person whose duty it is to disburse the same shall withhold and remits to 
the Court the amount due under the order, or the monthly instalments, as the case may be; 
(b) where such salary or allowances are to be disbursed beyond the said limits, the officer or other person 
within those limits whose duty it is to instruct the disbursing authority regarding the amount of the salary or 
allowances to the disbursed shall remit to the Court the amount due under the order, or the monthly instalments, as the case may be, and shall direct the disbursing authority to reduce the aggregate of the amounts from time to time, to be disbursed by the aggregate of the amounts from time to time remitted to the 
Courts. 
(2) Where the attachable proportion of such salary or allowances is already being withheld and remitted to a 
Court in pursuance of a previous and unsatisfied order of attachment, the officer appointed by the 
appropriate Government in this behalf shall forthwith return the subsequent order to the Court issuing it with 
a full statement of all the particulars of the existing attachment. 
[270] [(3) Every order made under this rule, unless it is returned in accordance with the provisions of sub-rule 
(2) shall, without further notice or other process, bind the appropriate Government or the railway company or 
local authority or corporation or Government company, as the case may be, while the judgment-debtor is 
within the local limits to which this Code for the time being extends and while he is beyond those limits, if he is in receipt of any salary or allowances payable out of the Consolidated Fund of India or the consolidated Fund of the State or the funds of a railway company or local authority or corporation or Government 
Company in India; and the appropriate Government or the railway company or local authority or corporation 
or Government company, as the case may be, shall be liable for any sum paid in contravention of the rule.]

administration or of a cantonment authority or of the port authority of a major port, or any servant of a 
corporation engaged in any trade or industry which is established by Central Act, or any servant of a

is the salary or allowances of an employee other than an employee to whom rule 48 applies, the Court, where the disbursing officer of the employee is within the local limits of the Court's jurisdiction, may order that the amount shall, subject to the provisions of section 60, be withheld from such salary or allowances either in one payment or by monthly instalments as the Court may direct; and upon notice of the order to such disbursing officer, such disbursing officer shall remit to the Court the amount due under the order, or the monthly instalments, as the case may be. 
(2) Where the attachable portion of such salary or allowances is already being withheld or remitted to the 
Court in pursuance of a previous and unsatisfied order of attachment, the disbursing officer shall forthwith 
return the subsequent order to the Court issuing it with a full statement of all the particulars of the existing 
attachment.

limits to which this Code for the time being extents and while he is beyond those-limits, if he is in receipt of salary or allowances payable out of the funds of an employer in any part of India; and the employer shall be 
liable for any sum paid in contravention of this rule.] 
49 . Attachment of partnership property— (1) Save as otherwise provided by this rule, property belonging to 
a partnership shall not be attached or sold in execution of a decree other than a decree passed against the 
firm or against the partners in the firm as such. 
(2) The Court may, on the application of the holder of a decree against a partner, make an order charging the 
interest of such partner in the partnership property, and profits with payment of the amount due under the 
decree, and may, by the same or a subsequent order, appoint a receiver of the share of such partner in the profits (whether already declared or accruing) and of any other money which may be coming to him in respect of the partnership, and direct accounts and inquiries and make an order for the sale of such interest or other orders as might have been directed or made if a charge had been made in favour of the degree-
holder by such partner, or as the circumstances of the case may require. 
(3) The other partner or partners shall be at liberty at any time to redeem the interest charged or, in the case 
of a sale being directed, to purchase the same. (4) Every application for an order under sub-rule (2) shall be served on the judgment-debtor and on his 
partners or such of them as are within India. (5) Every application made by any partner of the judgment-debtor under sub-rule (3) shall be served on the 
decree-holder and on the judgment-debtor, and on such of the other partners as do not join in the application 
and as are within India. 
(6) Service under sub-rule (4) or sub-rule (5) shall be deemed to be service on all the partners and all orders 
made on such application shall be similarly served. 50 . Execution of decree against firm— (1) Where a decree has been passed against a firm, execution may 
be granted— 
(a) against any property of the partnership; 
(b) against any person who has appeared in his own name under rule 6 or rule 7 of Order XXX or who has 
admitted on the pleadings that he is, or who has been adjudged to be, a partner; 
(c) against any person who has been individually served as a partner with a summons and has failed to 
appear: 
Provided that nothing in this sub-rule shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the provisions of 
[273][section 30 of the Indial Partnership Act, 1932 (9 of 1932)].

such property by virtue of any assignment, attachment or otherwise, shall be determined by such Court. 
53 . Attachment of decrees— (1) Where the property to be attached is a decree, either for the payment of

decree sought to be executed, to the holder of the decree sought to be attached, prohibiting him from 
transferring or charging the same in any way; and, where such decree has been passed by any other Court, 
also by sending to such other Court a notice to abstain from executing the decree sought to be attached until

debtor bound by the decree attached; and no payment or adjustment of the attached decree made by the judgment-debtor in contravention of such order [276][with knowledge thereof or] after receipt of notice thereof, either through the Court or otherwise, shall be recognized by any Court so long as the attachment 
remains in force. 
54 . Attachment of immovable property— (1) Where the property is immovable, the attachment shall be

all persons from taking any benefit from such transfer or charge. 
[277] [(1A) The order shall also require the judgment-debtor to attend Court on a specified date to take notice 
of the date to be fixed for settling the terms of the proclamation of sale.] (2) The order shall be proclaimed at some place on or adjacent to such property by beat of drum or other 
customary mode, and a copy of the order shall be affixed on a conspicuous part of the property and then 
upon a conspicuous part of the court-house, and also, where the property is land paying revenue to the Government in the office of the Collector of the district in which the land is situate [278][and, where the 
property is land situate in a village, also in the office of the Gram Panchayat, if any, having jurisdiction over 
that village.]

(a) the amount decreed with costs and all charges and expenses resulting from the attachment of any 
property are paid into Court, or 
(b) satisfaction of the decree is otherwise made through the Court or certified to the Court, or 
(c) the decree is set aside or reversed, 
the attachment shall be deemed to be withdrawn, and, in the case of immovable property, the withdrawal 
shall, if the judgment-debtor so desires, be proclaimed at his expense, and a copy of the proclamation shall 
be affixed in the manner prescribed by the last preceding rule. 
56 . Order for payment of coin or currency notes to party entitled under decree— Where the property 
attached is current coin or currency notes, the Court may, at any time during the continuance of the attachment, direct that such coin or notes, or a part thereof sufficient to satisfy the decree, be paid over to 
the party entitled under the decree to receive the same. 
[279][57 . Determination of attachment— (1) Where any property has been attached in execution of a decree 
and the Court, for any reason, passes an order dismissing the application for the execution of the decree, the Court shall direct whether the attachment shall continue or cease and shall also indicate the period up to 
which such attachment shall continue or the date on which such attachment shall cease. 
(2) If the Court omits to give such direction, the attachment shall be deemed to have ceased.]

58 . Adjudication of claims to, or objections to attachment of, property— (1) Where any claim is preferred to, 
or any objection is made to the attachment of, any property attached in execution of a decree on the ground that such property is not liable to such attachment, the Court shall proceed to adjudicate upon the claim or 
objection in accordance with the provisions herein contained: 
Provided that no such claim or objection shall be entertained— (a) where, before the claim is preferred or objection is made, the property attached has already been sold; or 
(b) where the Court considers that the claim or objection was designedly or unnecessarily delayed. 
(2) All questions (including questions relating to right, title or interest in the property attached) arising 
between the parties to a proceeding or their representatives under this rule and relevant to the adjudication 
of the claim or objection, shall be determined by the Court dealing with the claim or objection and not by a 
separate suit.

      (3) Upon the determination of the questions referred to in sub- rule (2), the Court shall, in accordance with 
such determination,—

thinks fit; or 
(b) disallow the claim or objection; or 
(c) continue the attachment subject to any mortgage, charge or other interest in favour of any person; or 
(d) pass such order as in the circumstances of the case it deems fit. 
(4) Where any claim or objection has been adjudicated upon under this rule, the order made thereon shall 
have the same force and be subject to the same conditions as to appeal or otherwise as if it were a decree. 
(5) Where a claim or an objection is preferred and the Court, under the proviso to sub-rule (1), refuses to 
entertain it, the party against whom such order is made may institute a suit to establish the right which he 
claims to the property in dispute; but, subject to the result of such suit, if any, an order so refusing to entertain the claims or objection shall be conclusive. 
59 . Stay of sale— Where before the claim was preferred or the objection was made, the property attached 
had already been advertised for sale, the Court may— 
(a) if the property is movable, make an order postponing the sale pending the adjudication of the claim or 
objection, or (b) if the property is immovable, make an order that, pending the adjudication of the claim or objection, the 
property shall not be sold, or, that pending such adjudication, the property may be sold but the sale shall not 
be confirmed, 
and any such order may be made subject to such terms and conditions as to security or otherwise as the 
Court thinks fit.]

65 . Sales by whom conducted and how made— Save as otherwise prescribed, every sale in execution of a 
decree shall be conducted by an officer of the Court or by such other person as the Court may appoint in this 
behalf, and shall be made by public auction in manner prescribed.

in execution of a decree, the Court shall cause a proclamation of the intended sale to be made in the 
language of such Court. 
(2) Such proclamation shall be draw up after notice to the decree-holder and the judgment-debtor and shall 
state the time and place of sale, and specify as fairly and accurately as possible— (a) the property to be sold [281][or, where a part of the property would be sufficient to satisfy the decree, 
such part]; (b) the revenue assessed upon the estate, where the property to be sold is an interest in an estate or in part 
of an estate paying revenue to the Government; 
(c) any incumbrance to which the property is liable; 
(d) the amount for the recovery of which the sale is ordered; and

judgement-debtor by means of an order under rule 54, it shall not be necessary to give notice under this rule 
to the judgment-debtor unless the Court otherwise directs: 
Provided further that nothing in this rule shall be construed as requiring the Court to enter in the proclamation 
of sale its own estimate of the value of the property, but the proclamation shall include the estimate if any, 
given, by either or both of the parties.] 
(3) Every application for an order for sale under this rule shall be accompanied by a statement signed and

mortgagee, and unless the Court otherwise directs, the reserve price shall be— (a) not less than the amount then due for principal, interest and costs in respect of the mortgage if the 
property is sold in one lot; and (b) in the case of any property sold in lots, not less than such sum as shall appear to the Court to be properly 
attributable to each lot in relation to the amount then due for principal, interest and costs on the mortgage. (3) In other respects, the provisions of sub-rules (2) and (3) of rule 72 shall apply in relation to purchase by 
the decree-holder under that rule.] 73 . Restriction on bidding or purchase by officers— No officer or other person having any duty to perform in

Explanation.—An application referred to in sub-rule (1) includes a claim or objection made under rule 58. 
106 . Setting aside order passed BIex parte, etc.— (1) The applicant, against whom an order is made under 
sub-rule (2) rule 105 or the opposite party against whom an order is passed ex parte under sub-rule (3) of that rule or under sub-rule (1) of rule 23, may apply to the Court to set aside the order, and if he satisfies the Court that there was sufficient cause for his non- appearance when the application was called on for hearing, the Court shall set aside the order or such terms as to costs, or otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall appoint a 
day for the further hearing of the application. 
(2) No order shall be made on an application under sub-rule (1) unless notice of the application has been 
served on the other party. (3) An application under sub-rule (1) shall be made within thirty days from the date of the order, or where, in 
the case of an ex parte order, the notice was not duly served, within thirty days from the date when applicant

ORDER XXII- DEATH, MARRIAGE AND INSOLVENCY OR PARTIES 
1 . No abatement by party's death if right to sue survives— The death of a plaintiff or defendant shall not 
cause the suit to abate if the right to sue survives. 
2 . Procedure where one of several plaintiffs or defendants dies and right to sue survives— Where there are 
more plaintiffs or defendants than one, and any of them dies, and where the right to sue survives to the surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs alone, or against the surviving defendant or defendants alone, the Court shall cause an entry to the effect to be made on the record, and the suit shall proceed at the instance of the 
surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs, or against the surving defendant or defendants. 
3 . Procedure in case of death of one of several plaintiffs or of sole plaintiff— (1) Where one of two or more 
plaintiffs dies and the right to sue does not survive to the surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs alone, or a sole plaintiff or sole surviving plaintiff dies and the right to the sue survives, the Court, on an application made in that behalf, shall cause the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff to be made a party and shall 
proceed with the suit. 
(2) Where within the time limited by law no application is made under sub-rule (1), the suit shall abate so far 
as the deceased plaintiff is concerned, and, on the application of the defendant, the Court may award to him 
the costs which he may have incurred in defending the suit, to be recovered from the estate of the deceased 
plaintiff. 
4 . Procedure in case of death of one of several defendants or of sole defendant— (1) Where one of two or 
more defendants dies and the right to sue does not survive against the surviving defendant or defendants alone, or a sole defendant or sole surviving defendant dies and the right to sue survives, the Court, on an application made in that behalf, shall cause the legal representative of the deceased defendant to be made a party and shall proceed with the suit. 
(2) Any person so made a party may make any defence appropriate to his character as legal representative 
of the deceased defendant. 
(3) Where within the time limited by law no application is made under sub-rule (1), the suit shall abate as 
against the deceased defendant. [295] [(4) The Court whenever it thinks fit, may exempt the plaintiff from the necessity of substituting the legal 
representatives of any such defendant who has failed to file a written statement or who, having filed it, has 
failed to appear and contest the suit at the hearing; and judgment may, in such case, be pronounced against 
the said defendant not withstanding the death of such defendant and shall have the same force and effect as 
if it has been pronounced before death took place. 
(5) Where— 
(a) the plaintiff was ignorant of the death of a defendant, and could not, for that reason, make an application 
for the substitution of the legal representative of the defendant under this rule within the period specified in 
the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963) and the suit has, in consequence, abated, and

         (b) the plaintiff applies after the expiry of the period specified therefor in the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), 
for setting aside the abatement and also for the admission of that application under section 5 of that Act on 
the ground that he had, by reason of such ignorance, sufficient cause for not making the application within 
the period specified in the said Act, 
the Court shall, in considering the application under the said section 5, have due regard to the fact of such 
ignorance, if proved.] 
[296][4A . Procedure where there is no legal representative— (1) If, in any suit, it shall appear to the Court 
that any party who has died during the pendency of the suit has no legal representative, the Court may, on the application of any party to the suit, proceed in the absence of a person representing the estate of the deceased person, or may by order appoint the Administrator-General, or an officer of the Court or such other person as it thinks fit to represent the estate of the deceased person for the purpose of the suit; and any judgment or order subsequently given or made in the suit shall bind the estate of the deceased person to the 
same extent as he would have been bound if a personal representative of the deceased person had been a 
party to the suit. 
(2) Before making an order under this rule, the Court— 
(a) may require notice of the application for the order to be given to such (if any) of the persons having an 
interest in the estate of the deceased person as it thinks fit; and 
(b) shall ascertain that the person proposed to be appointed to represent the estate of the deceased person 
is willing to be so appointed and has no interest adverse to that of the deceased person.] 5 . Determination of question as to legal representative— Where a question arises as to whether any person 
is or is not the legal representative of a deceased plaintiff or a deceased defendant, such question shall be 
determined by the Court: 
[297][Provided that where such question arises before an Appellate Court, that Court may, before 
determining the question, direct any subordinate Court to try the question and to return the records together with evidence, if any, recorded at such trial, its findings and reasons therefor, and the Appellate Court may 
take the same into consideration in determining the question.] 
6 . No abatement by reason of death after hearing— Nothwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing 
rules, whether the cause of action survives or not, there shall be no abatement by reason of the death of either party between the conclusion of the hearing and the pronouncing of the judgment, but judgment may 
in such case be pronounced notwithstanding the death and shall have the same force and effect as if it had 
been pronounced before the death took place. 
7 . Suit not abated by marriage of female party— (1) The marriage of a female plaintiff or defendant shall not 
cause the suit to abate, but the suit may notwithstanding be proceeded with to judgment, and, where the 
decree is against a female defendant, it may be executed against her alone. 
(2) Where the husband is by law liable for the debts of his wife, the decree may, with the permission of the 
Court, be executed against the husband also; and in case of judgment for the wife, execution of the decree 
may, with such permission, be issued upon the application of the husband, where the husband is by law 
entitled to the subject matter of the decree. 
8 . When plaintiffs insolvency bars suit— (1) The insolvency of a plaintiff in any suit which the assignee or 
receiver might maintain for the benefit of his creditors, shall not cause the suit to abate, unless such assignee or receiver declines to continue the suit or (unless for any special reason the Court otherwise 
directs) to give security for the costs thereof within such time as the Court may direct. 
(2) Procedure where assignee fails to continue suit, or give security—Where the assignee or receiver 
neglects or refuses to continue the suit and to give such security within the time so ordered, the defendant 
may apply for the dismissal of the suit on the ground of the plaintiff's insolvency, and the Court may make an order dismissing the suit and awarding to the defendant the costs which he has insured in defending the 
same to be proved as a debt against the plaintiff's estate. 
9 . Effect of abatement or dismissal— (1) Where a suit abates or is dismissed under this Order, no fresh suit 
shall be brought on the same cause of action.

           (2) The plaintiff or the person claiming to be the legal representative of a deceased plaintiff or the assignee 
or the receiver in the case of an insolvent plaintiff may apply for an order to set aside the abatement or 
dismissal; and if it is proved that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from continuing the suit, the Court 
shall set aside the abatement or dismissal upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit. 
(3) The provisions of section 5 of the [298][Indian Limitation Act, 1877 (15 of 1877)] shall apply to 
applications under sub-rule (2). [299][Explanation—Nothing in this rule shall be construed as barring, in any later suit, a defence based on 
the facts which constituted the cause of action in the suit which had abated or had been dismissed under this 
Order] 
10 . Procedure in case of assignment before final order in suit— (1) In other cases of an assignment, 
creation or devolution of any interest during the pendency of a suit, may, by leave of the Court, be continued 
by or against the person to or upon whom such interest has come or devolved. 
(2) The attachment of a decree pending an appeal therefrom shall be deemed to be an interest entitling the 
person who procured such attachment to the benefit of sub-rule (1). [300][10A . Duty or pleader to communicate to Court death of a party— Wherever a pleader appearing for a 
party to the suit comes to know of the death of that party, he shall inform the Court about it, and the Court shall there upon give notice of such death to the other party, and, for this purpose, the contract between the 
pleader and the deceased party shall be deemed to subsist.] 
11 . Application of Order to appeals— In the application of this Order to appeals, so far as may be, the word 
"plaintiff" shall be held to include an appellant, the word "defendant" a respondent, and the word "suit" an 
appeal. 
12 . Application of Order to proceedings— Nothing in rules 3, 4 and 8 shall apply to proceedings in executive 
of a decree or order. 
ORDER XXIII- WITHDRAWAL AND ADJUSTMENT OF SUITS 
[301][1 . Withdrawal of suit or abandonment of part of claim— (1) At any time after the institution of a suit, the 
plaintiff may as against all or any of the defendants abandon his suit or abandon a part of his claim: 
Provided that where the plaintiff is a minor or other person to whom the provisions contained in rules 1 to 14 
of Order XXXII extend, neither the suit nor any part of the claim shall be abandoned without the leave of the 
Court. 
(2) An application for leave under the proviso to sub-rule (1) shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the next 
friend and also, if the minor or such other person is represented by a pleader, by a certificate of the pleader 
to the effect that the abandonment proposed is, in his opinion, for the benefit of the minor or such other 
persons. 
(3) Where the Court is satisfied,— 
(a) that a suit must fail by reason of some formal defect, or 
(b) that there are sufficient grounds for allowing the plaintiff to institute a fresh suit for the subject-matter of a 
suit or part of a claim, it may, on such terms as it thinks fit, grant the plaintiff permission to withdraw from such suit or such part of 
the claim with liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect of the subject- matter of such suit or such part of the 
claim. 
(4) Where the plaintiff— 
(a) abandons any suit or part of claim under sub-rule (1), or 
(b) withdraws from a suit or part of a claim without the permission referred to in sub-rule (3), 
he shall be liable for such costs as the Court may award and shall be preclude from instituting any fresh suit 
in respect of such subject-matter or such part of the claim.

suit or part of a claim under sub-rule (1), or to withdraw, under sub-rule (3), any suit or part of a claim, 
without the consent of the other plaintiffs.] 
[302][1A . When transposition of defendants as plaintiffs may be permitted— Where a suit is withdrawn or 
abandoned by a plaintiff under rule 1, and a defendant applies to be transposed as a plaintiff under rule 10 of Order I the Court shall, in considering such application, have due regard to the question whether the 
applicant has a substantial question to be decided as against any of the other defendants.] 
2 . Limitation law not affected by first suit— In any fresh suit instituted on permission granted under the last 
preceding rule, the plaintiff shall be bound by the law of limitation in the same manner as if the first suit had 
not been instituted. 
3 . Compromise of suit— Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that a suit has been adjusted 
wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise [303][in writing and signed by the parties] or where the defendant satisfied the plaintiff in respect of the whole or any part of the subject-matter of the suit, the Court shall order such agreement, compromise satisfaction to be recorded, and shall pass a decree is accordance therewith [304][so far as it relates to the parties to the suit, whether or not the subject-matter of the agreement, compromise or satisfaction is the same as the subject-matter of the suit:] 
[305] [Provided that where it is alleged by one party and denied by the other that an adjustment or 
satisfaction has been arrived at, the Court shall decide the question; but not adjournment shall be granted for 
the purpose of deciding the question, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded, thinks fit to grant such 
adjournment.] 
[306] [Explanation—An agreement or compromise which is void or voidable under the Indian Contract Act, 
1872 (9 of 1872), shall not be deemed to be lawful within the meaning of this rule;] [307][3A . Bar to suit— No suit shall lie to set aside a decree on the ground that the compromise on which 
the decree is based was not lawful. 
3B . No agreement or compromise to be entered in a representative suit without leave of Court— (1) no 
agreement or compromise in a representative suit shall be entered into without the leave of the Court 
expressly recorded in the proceedings; and any such agreement or compromise entered into without the 
leave of the Court so recorded shall be void.

as may appear to it to be interested in the suit.

(b) a suit under rule 8 of Order I, 
(c) a suit in which the manager of an undivided Hindu family sues or is sued as representing the other

               3 . Interest on deposit not allowed to plaintiff after notice— No interest shall be allowed to the plaintiff on any 
sum deposited by the defendant from the date of the receipt of such notice, whether the sum deposited is in 
full of the claim or falls short thereof. 
4 . Procedure where plaintiff accepts deposit as satisfaction in part— (1) Where the plaintiff accepts such 
amount as satisfaction in part only of his claim he may prosecute suit for the balance; and, if the Court decides that the deposit by the defendant was a full satisfaction of the plaintiff's claim, the plaintiff shall pay the costs of the suit incurred after the deposit and the costs incurred previous thereto, so far as they were 
caused by excess in the plaintiff's claim. 
(2) Procedure where he accepts it as satisfaction in full—Where the plaintiff accepts such amount as 
satisfaction in full of his claim he shall present to the Court a statement to that effect, and such statement 
shall be filed and the Court shall pronounce judgment accordingly; and, in directing by whom the costs of 
each party are to be paid, the Court shall consider which of the parties is most to blame for the litigation.

filed. A pays the money into Court, B accepts it in full satisfaction of his claim, but the Court should not allow 
him any costs, the litigation being presumably groundless on his part. 
(b) B sues A under the circumstance mentioned in illustration (a). On the plaint being filed, A disputes the 
claim. Afterwards A pays the money into Court. B accepts it in full satisfaction of his claim. The Court should 
also give B his cast of suit. A's conduct having shown that the litigation was necessary.

amount. On the plaint being filed, A pays Rs. 100 into Court and disputes only his liability to pay the 
remaining Rs. 50. B accepts the Rs. 100 in full satisfaction of his claim. The Court should order him to pay A's costs.

defendant:

and, if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from 
furnishing the security within the time allowed, the Court shall set aside the dismissal upon such terms as to 
security, costs or otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit.

the person from filing a defence denying the liability of the firm in respect of the claim against the defendant. (4) If the Court, however, holds that such person was not a partner of the firm and was not liable as such that 
shall not preclude the plaintiff from otherwise serving a summons on the firm and proceeding with the suit; 
but in that event, the plaintiff shall be precluded from alleging the laibility of that person as a partner of the 
firm in execution of any decree that may be passed against the firm.] 
9 . Suits between co-partners— This Order shall apply to suits between a firm and one or more of the

business in a name or style other than his own name, or a Hindu undivided family carrying on business under any name, may be sued in such name or style as if it were a firm name, and, in so far as the nature of

1 . Minor to sue by next friend— Every suit by a minor shall be instituted in his name by a person who in 
such shall be called the next friend of the minor. 
[326]Explanation—In this Order, "minor" means a person who has not attained his majority within the 
meaning of section 3 of the Indian Majority Act, 1875 (9 of 1875) where the suit relates to any of the matters 
mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of section 2 of that Act or to any other matter.] 
2 . Where suit is instituted without next friend, plaint to be taken off the file— (1) Where a suit is instituted by 
or on behalf of a minor without a next friend, the defendant may apply to have the plaint taken off the file, 
with costs to be paid by the pleader or other person by whom it was presented. 
(2) Notice of such application shall be given to such person, and the Court, after hearing his objections (if 
any) may make such order in the matter as it thinks fit. 
[327][2A . Security to be furnished by next friend when so ordered— (1) Where a suit has been instituted on 
behalf of the minor by his next friend, the Court may, at any stage of the suit, either of its own motion or on 
the application of any defendant, and for the reasons to be recorded, order the next friend to give security for 
the payment of all costs incurred or likely to be incurred by the defendant. 
(2) Where such a suit is instituted by an indigent person, the security shall include the court-fees payable to 
the Government. 
(3) The provisions of rule 2 of Order XXV shall, so far as may be, apply to a suit where the Court makes an 
order under this rule directing security to be furnished.] 3 . Guardian for the suit to be appointed by Court for minor defendant— (1) Where the defendant is a minor 
the Court, on being satisfied of the fact of his minority, shall appoint a proper person to be guardian for the 
suit for such minor. 
(2) An order for the appointment of a guardian for the suit may be obtained upon application in the name and 
on behalf of the minor or by the plaintiff. (3) Such application shall be supported by an affidavit verifying the fact that the proposed guardian has no 
interest in the matters in controversy in the suit adverse to that of the minor and that he is a fit person to be 
so appointed. 
(4) Order shall be made on any application under this rule except upon notice to any [328]*** to any guardian 
of the minor appointed or declared by an authority competent in that behalf, or, where there is no such 
guardian, [329][upon notice to the father or where there is no father, to the mother, or where there is no 
father or mother, to other natural guardian] of the minor, or, where there is [330][no father, mother or other natural guardian], to the person in whose care the minor is, and after hearing any objection which may be 
urged on behalf of any person served with notice under this sub-rule. 
[331][(4A) The Court may, in any case, if it thinks fit, issue notice under sub-rule (4) to the minor also.] (5) A person appointed under sub-rule (1) to be guardian for the suit for a minor shall, unless his appointment 
is terminated by retirement, removal or death, continue as such throughout all proceedings arising out of the 
suit including proceedings in any Appellate or Revisional Court and any proceedings in the execution of a 
decree. 
[332][3A . Decree against minor to be set aside unless prejudice has been caused to his interests— (1) No 
decree passed against a minor shall be set aside merely on the ground that the next friend or guardian for the suit of the minor had an interest in the subject-matter of the suit adverse to that of the minor, but the fact that by reasons of such adverse interest of the next friend of guardian for the suit, prejudice has been caused 
to the interests of the minor, shall be a ground for setting aside the decree.

4 . Who may act as next friend or be appointed guardian for the suit— (1) Any person who is of sound mind 
and has attained majority may act as next friend of a minor or as his guardian for the suit: 
Provided that the interest of such person is not adverse to that of the minor and that he is not, in the case of 
a next friend, a defendant, or, in the case of a guardian for the suit, a plaintiff. 
(2) Where a minor has a guardian appointed or declared by competent authority, no person other than such 
guardian shall act as the next friend of the minor or be appointed his guardian for the suit unless the Court 
considers, for reasons to be recorded, that it is for the minor's welfare that another person be permitted to act 
or be appointed, as the case may be. 
(3) No person shall without his consent [333][in writing] be appointed guardian for the suit. 
(4) Where there is no other person fit and willing to act as guardian for the suit, for Court may appoint any of 
its officers to be such guardian, and may direct that the costs to be incurred by such officer in the 
performance of his duties as such guardian shall be borne either by the parties or by any one or more of the parties to the suit, or out of any fund in Court in which the minor is interested [334][or out of the property of the minor], and may give directions for the repayment or allowance of such costs as justice and the 
circumstances of the case may require. 
5 . Representation of minor by next friend or guardian for the suit— (1) Every application to the Court on 
behalf of a minor, other than an application under rule 10, sub-rule (2), shall be made by his next friend or by 
his guardian for the suit. 
(2) Every order made in a suit or on any application, before the Court in or by which a minor is in any way 
concerned or affected, without such minor being represented by a next friend or guardian for the suit, as the 
case may be, may be discharged, and, where the pleader of the party at whose instance such order was obtained knew, or might reasonably have known, the fact of such minority, with costs to be paid by such 
pleader. 
6 . Receipt by next friend or guardian for the suit of property under decree for minor— (1) A next friend or 
guardian for the suit shall not, without the leave of the Court, receive any money or other movable property

(b) under a decree or order in favour of the minor. 
(2) Where the next friend or guardian for the suit has not been appointed or declared by competent authority 
to be guardian of the property of the minor, or, having been so appointed or declared, is under any disability 
known to the Court to receive the money or other movable property, the Court shall, if it grants him leave to receive the property, require such security and give such directions as will, in its opinion, sufficiently protect 
the property from waste and ensure its proper application: 
[335][Provided that the Court may, for reasons to be recorded, dispense with such security while granting 
leave to the next friend or guardian for the suit to receive money or other movable property under a decree or 
order, where such next friend or guardian— 
(a) is the manager of a Hindu undivided family and the decree or order relates to the property or business of 
the family; or 
(b) is the parent of the minor.] 
7 . Agreement or compromise by next friend or guardian for the suit— (1) No next friend or guardian for the 
suit shall, without the leave of the Court, expressly recorded in the proceedings, enter into any agreement or 
compromise on behalf of a minor with reference to the suit in which he acts as next friend or guardian.

of the guardian for the suit, as the case may be, and also, if the minor is represented by a pleader, by the certificate of the pleader, to the effect that the agreement or compromise proposed is, in his opinion, for the 
benefit of the minor:

                  Provided that the opinion so expressed, whether in the affidavit or in the certificate shall not preclude the 
Court from examining whether the agreement or compromise proposed is for the benefit of the minor.] 
(2) Any such agreement or compromise entered into without the leave of the Court so recorded shall be 
voidable against all parties other than the minor. 8 . Retirement of next friend— (1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, a next friend shall not retire 
without first procuring a fit person to be put in his place and giving security for the costs already incurred. 
(2) The application for the appointment of a new next friend shall be supported by an affidavit showing the 
fitness of the person proposed and also that he has no interest adverse to that of the minor. 9 . Removal of next friend— (1)Where the interest of the next friend of a minor is adverse to that of the minor 
or where he is so connected with a defendant whose interest is adverse to that of the minor as to make it unlikely that the minor's interest will be properly protected by him, or where he does not do his duty, or during the pendency of the suit, ceases to reside within India or for any other sufficient cause, application may be made on behalf of the minor or by a defendant for his removal; and the Court, if satisfied of the sufficiency of the cause assigned, may order the next friend to be removed accordingly, and make such other order as to 
costs as it thinks fit. 
(2) Where the next friend is not a guardian appointed or declared by an authority competent in this behalf, 
and an application is made by a guardian so appointed or declared, who desires to be himself appointed in 
the place of the next friend, the Court shall remove that next friend unless it considers, for reasons to be recorded by it, that the guardian ought not to be appointed the next friend of the minor and shall thereupon appoint the applicant to be next friend in his place upon such terms as to the costs already incurred in the 
suit as it thinks fit. 
10 . Stay of proceedings on removal, etc., of next friend— (1) On the retirement, removal or death of the next 
friend of a minor, further proceedings shall be stayed until the appointment of a next friend in his place. 
(2) Where the pleader of such minor omits, within a reasonable time, to take steps to get a new friend 
appointed, any person interested in the minor or in the matter in issue may apply to the Court for the 
appointment of one, and the Court may appoint such person as it thinks fit. 
11 . Retirement, removal or death of guardian for the suit— (1) Where the guardian for the suit desire to 
retire or does not do his duty, or where there sufficient ground is made to appear, the Court may permit such 
guardian to retire or may remove him, and may make such order as to costs as it thinks fit. 
(2) Where the guardian for the suit retires, dies or is removed by the Court during the pendency of the suit, 
the Court shall appoint a new guardian in his place. 12 . Course to be followed by minor plaintiff or applicant on attaining majority— (1) A minor plaintiff or a 
minor not a party to a suit on whose behalf an application is pending shall, on attaining majority, elect 
whether he will proceed with the suit or application. 
(2) Where he elects to proceed with the suit or application, he shall apply for an order discharging the next 
friend and for leave to proceed in his own name. 
(3) The title of the suit or application shall in such case be corrected so as to read henceforth thus: 
"A.B., late a minor, by C.D., his next friend, but now having attained majority." 
(4) Where he elects to abandon the suit or application, he shall, if a sole plaintiff or sole applicant, apply for 
an order to dismiss the suit or application on repayment of the costs incurred by the defendant or opposite 
party or which may have been paid by his next friend. 
(5) Any application under this rule may be made ex parte but no order discharging a next friend and 
permitting a minor plaintiff to proceed in his own name shall be made without notice to the next friend. 13 . Where minor co-plaintiff attaining, majority desires to repudiate suit— (1) Where a minor co-plaintiff on 
attaining majority desires to repudiate the suit, he shall apply to have his name struck out as co-plaintiff; and the Court, if it finds that he is not a necessary party shall dismiss him from the suit on such terms as to costs 
or otherwise as it thinks fit. 
(2) Notice of the application shall be served on the next friend, on any co-plaintiff and on the defendant.

of such unreasonableness or impropriety, grant the application and order the next friend to pay the costs of 
all parties in respect of the application and of anything done in the suit, or make such other order as it thinks 
fit.

actually suing the plaintiff in respect the subject-matter of such suit, the Court in which the suit against the plaintiff is pending shall, on being informed by the Court in which the interpleader-suit has been instituted, 
stay the proceedings as against him; and his costs in the suit so stayed may be provided for in such suit; but 
if, and in so far as, they are not provided for in that suit, they may be added to his costs incurred in the 
interpleader-suit. 
4 . Procedure at first hearing— (1) At the first hearing the Court may— (a) declare that the plaintiff is discharged from all liability to the defendants in respect of the thing claimed, 
award him his costs, and dismiss him from the suit; or 
(b) if it thinks that justice or convenience so require, retain all parties until the final disposal of the suit. 
(2) Where the Court finds that the admissions of the parties or other evidence enable it to do so, it may 
adjudicate the title to the thing claimed. 
(3) Where the admissions of the parties do not enable the Court so to adjudicate, it may direct— 
(a) that an issue or issues between the parties be framed and tried, and 
(b) that any claimant be made a plaintiff in lieu of or in addition to the original plaintiff, 
and shall proceed to try the suit in the ordinary manner. 5 . Agents and tenants may not institute interpleader suits— Nothing in the Order shall be deemed to enable

security for a debt due from himself to C. A afterwards alleges that C's debt is satisfied, and C alleges the 
contrary. Both claim the jewels from B. B may institute in interpleader-suit against A and C. 
6 . Charge for plaintiff's costs— Where the suit is properly instituted the Court may provide for the costs of

revenue to Government, or a tenure liable to sale, is the subject-matter of a suit, if the party in possession of such land or tenure neglects to pay the Government revenue, or the rent due to the proprietor of the tenure, as the case may be, and such land or tenure is consequently ordered to be sold, any other party to the suit claiming to have an interest in such land or tenure may, upon payment of the revenue or rent due previously to the sale (and with or without security at the discretion of the Court), be put in immediate possession of the 
land or tenure;

heard in support of any ground of objection not set forth in the memorandum of appeal, but the Appellate Court in deciding the appeal, shall not be confined to the grounds of objections set forth in the memorandum 
of appeal or taken by leave of the Court under this rule: 
Provided that the Court shall not rest its decision on any other ground unless the party who may be affected 
thereby has had a sufficient opportunity of contesting the case on that ground.

               3 . Rejection or amendment of memorandum— (1) Where the memorandum of appeal is not drawn up in the 
manner hereinbefore prescribed, it may be rejected, or be returned to the appellant for the purpose of being 
amended within a time to be fixed by the Court or be amended then and there. 
(2) Where the Court rejects any memorandum, it shall record the reasons for such rejection. 
(3) Where a memorandum of appeal is amended, the Judge, or such officer as he appoints in this behalf, 
shall sign or initial the amendment.

period of limitation specified therefor, it shall be accompanied by an application supported by affidavit setting forth the facts on which the appellant relies to satisfy the Court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring 
the appeal within such period. 
(2) If the Court sees no reason to reject the application without the issue of a notice to the respondent, notice 
hereof shall be issued to the respondent and the matter shall be finally decided by the Court before it 
proceeds to deal with the appeal under rule 11 or rule 13, as the case may be. 
(3) Where an application has been made under sub-rule (1) the Court shall not made an order fact the stay 
of execution of the decree against which the appeal is proposed to be filed so long as the Court does not, 
after hearing under rule 11, decide to hear the appeal.] 
4 . One of several plaintiff or defendants may obtain reversal of whole decree where it proceeds on ground 
common to all— Where there are more plaintiff or more defendants then one in a suit, and the decree appealed from proceeds on any ground common to all the plaintiffs or to all the defendants, any one of the plaintiffs or of the defendants may appeal from the whole decree, and thereupon the Appellate Court may 
reverse or vary the decree in favour of all the plaintiffs or defendants, as the case may be. 
Stay of proceedings and of execution 
5 . Stay by Appellate Court— (1) An appeal shall not operate as a stay of proceedings under a decree or 
order appealed from except so far as the Appellate Court may order, nor shall execution of a decree be stayed by reason only of an appeal having been preferred from the decree; but the Appellate Court may for 
sufficient cause order stay of execution of such decree.

from the date of the communication of such order to the Court of first instance but an affidavit sworn by the 
appellant, based on his personal knowledge, stating that an order for the stay of execution of the decree has been made by the Appellate Court shall, pending the receipt from the Appellate Court of the order for the 
stay of execuiton or any order to the contrary, be acted upon by the Court of first instance.] 
(2) Stay by Court which passed the decree—Where an application is made for stay of execution of an 
appealable decree before the expiration of the time allowed for appealing therefrom, the Court which passed 
the decree may on sufficient cause being shown order the execution to be stayed. 
(3) No order for stay of execution shall be made under sub-rule (1) or sub-rule (2) unless the Court making it 
is satisfied— 
(a) that substantial loss may result to the party applying for stay of execution unless the order is made; 
(b) that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and 
(c) that security has been given by the applicant for the due performance of such decree or order as may 
ultimately be binding upon him. 
(4) [400][Subject to the provisions of sub-rule (3)], the Court may make an ex parte order for stay of 
execution pending the hearing of the application. [401] [(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing sub-rules, where the appellant fails to make

(2) Appellate Court may itself cause notice to be served—Instead of sending the notice to the Court from 
whose decree the appeal is preferred, the Appellate Court may itself cause the notice to be served on the 
respondent or his pleader under the provisions above referred to.

appeal.

hearing may be adjourned, the appellant does not appear when the appeal is called on for hearing, the Court 
may make an order that the appeal be dismissed. 
[405] [Explanation—Nothing in this sub-rule shall be construed as empowering the Court to dismiss the 
appeal on the merits.] (2) Hearing appeal BIex parteB—Where the appellant appears and the respondent does not appear the 
appeal shall be heard ex parte, 18 . Dismissal of appeal where notice not served in consequence of appellant's failure to deposit costs— 
Where on the day fixed, or on any other day to which the hearing may be adjourned, it is found that the notice to the respondent has not been served in consequence of the failure of the appellant to deposit, within the period fixed, the sum required to defray the costs of serving the notice [406][or, if the notice is returned unserved, and it is found that the notice to the respondent has not been issued in consequence of the failure of the appellant to deposit, within any subsequent period fixed, the sum required to defray the cost of any 
further attempt to serve the notice,] the Court may make an order that the appeal be dismissed: 
Provided that no such order shall be made although the notice has not been served upon the respondent, if 
on any such day the respondent appears when the appeal is called on for hearing.

terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit. 
20 . Power to adjourn hearing and direct persons appearing interested to be made respondents— [407][(1)] 
Where it appears to the Court at the hearing that any person who was a party to the suit in the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred, but who has not been made a party to the appeal, is interested in the result of the appeal, the Court may adjourn the hearing to a future day to be fixed by the Court and direct that 
such person be made a respondent. 
[408] [(2) No respondent shall be added under this rule, after the expiry of the period of limitation for appeal, 
unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded, allows that to be done, on such terms as to costs as it thinks 
fit.] 
21 . Re-hearing on application of respondent against whom BIex parte decree made— Where an appeal is 
heard ex parte and judgment is pronounced against the respondent, he may apply to the Appellant Court to re-hear the appeal; and, if he satisfies the Court that the notice was not duly served or that he was prevented by sufficient cause from appearing when the appeal was called on for hearing, the Court shall re-hear the 
appeal on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit to impose upon him. 
22 . Upon hearing respondent may object to decree as if he had preferred a separate appeal— (1) Any 
respondent, though he may not have appealed from any part of the decree, may not only support the decree [409][but may also state that the finding against him in the Court below in respect of any issue ought to have 
been in his favour; and may also take any cross-objection] to the decree which he could have taken by way 
of appeal provided he has filed such objection in the Appellant Court within one month from the date of service on him or his pleader of notice of the day fixed for hearing the appeal, or within such further time as 
the Appellate Court may see fit to allow. 
[410] [Explanation—A respondent aggrieved by a finding of the Court in the judgment on which the decree 
appealed against is based may, under this rule, file cross-objection in respect of the decree in so far as it is 
based on that finding, notwithstanding that by reason of the decision of the Court on any other finding which 
is sufficient for the decision of the suit, the decree, is, wholly or in part, in favour of that respondent.] 
(2) Form of objection and provisions applicable thereto—Such cross-objection shall be in the form of a 
memorandum, and the provisions of rule 1, so far as they relate to the form and contents of the 
memorandum of appeal, shall apply thereto. 
(3) Unless the respondent files with the objection a written acknowledgement from the party who may be 
affected by such objection or his pleader of having received a copy thereof, the Appellate Court shall cause a 
copy to be served, as soon as may be after the filing of the objection, on such party or his pleader at the 
expense of the respondent. 
(4) Where, in any case in which any respondent has under this rule filed a memorandum of objection, the 
original appeal is withdrawn or is dismissed for default, the objection so filed may nevertheless be heard and 
determined after such notice to the other parties as the Court thinks fit. 
(5) The provisions-relating to appeal by indigent persons shall, so far as they can be made applicable apply 
to an objection under this rule. 23 . Remand of case by Appellate Court— Where the Court from whose decree an appeal is preferred has 
disposed of the suit upon a preliminary point and the decree is reversed in appeal, the Appellate Court may, if it thinks fit, by order remand the case, and may further direct what issue or issues shall be tried in the case so remanded, and shall send a copy of its judgment and order to the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred, which directions to re-admit the suit under its original number in the register of civil suits, and proceed to determine the suit; and the evidence (if any) recorded during the original trial shall, subject to all 
just exceptions, be evidence during the trial after remand. 
[411][23A . Remand in other cases— Where the Court from whose decree an appeal is preferred has 
disposed of the case otherwise than on a preliminary point, and the decree is reversed in appeal and a re -
trial is considered necessary, the Appellate Court shall have the same powers as it has under rule 23.] 
24 . Where evidence on record sufficient, Appellate Court may determine case finally— Where the evidence 
upon the record is sufficient to enable the Appellate Court to pronounce judgment, the Appellate Court may, after resettling the issues, if necessary, finally determine the suit, notwithstanding that the judgment of the 
148
                   
    
                  
                  
                  
                    
                   
   
                 
                  
         
                  
                     
        
                
        
                 
                        
                  
             
                  
             
                   
   
               
                  
              
                  
       
                
                 
    
               
                
                  
 
                  
                   
    
   
               
                  
               
                    
 
                   
                    
                    
             Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has proceeded wholly upon some ground other than that on 
which Appellate Court proceeds. 
25 . Where Appellate Court may frame issues and refer them for trial to Court whose decree appealed 
from— Where the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has omitted to frame or try any issue, or to determine any question of fact, which appears to the Appellate Court essential to the right decision of the suit upon the merits the Appellate Court may, if necessary, frame issues, and refer the same for trial to the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred, and in such case shall direct such Court to take the 
additional evidence required; 
and such Court shall proceed to try such issues, and shall return the evidence to the Appellate Court 
together with its findings thereon and the reasons therefor [412][within such time as may be fixed by the 
Appellate Court or extended by it from time to time.] 
26 . Finding and evidence to be put on record. Objections to finding— (1) Such evidence and findings shall 
form part of the record in the suit; and either party may within a time to be fixed by the Appellate Court, 
present a memorandum of objections to any finding. 
(2) Determination of appeal—After the expiration of the period so fixed for presenting such memorandum the 
Appellate Court shall proceed to determine the appeal. [413][26A . Order of remand to mention date of next hearing— Where the Appellate Court remands a case 
under rule 23 or rule 23A, or frames issues and refers them for trial under rule 25, it shall fix a date for the appearance of the parties before the Court from whose decree the appeal was preferred for the purpose of 
receiving the directions of that Court as to further proceedings in the suit.] 
27 . Production of additional evidence in Appellate Court— (1) The parties to an appeal shall not be entitled 
to produce additional evidence, whether oral or documentary, in the Appellate Court, But if— 
(a) the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has refused to admit evidence which ought to have 
been admitted, or [414] [(aa) the party seeking to produce additional evidence, establishes that notwithstanding the exercise of 
due diligence, such evidence was not within his knowledge or could not, after the exercise of due diligence, 
be produced by him at the time when the decree appealed against was passed, or] 
(b) the Appellate Court requires any document to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable it to 
pronounce judgment, or for any other substantial cause, 
the Appellate Court may allow such evidence or document to be produced, or witness to be examined. 
(2) Wherever additional evidence is allowed to be produced by an Appellate Court, the Court shall record the 
reason for its admission. 28 . Mode of taking additional evidence— Wherever additional evidence is allowed to be produced, the 
Appellate Court may either take such evidence or direct the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred, or any other subordinate Court, to take such evidence and to send it when taken to the Appellate 
Court. 
29 . Points to be defined and recorded— Where additional evidence is directed or allowed to be taken, the 
Appellate Court shall specify the points to which the evidence is to be confined and record on its proceedings 
the points so specified.

their pleaders and referring to any part of the proceedings, whether on appeal or in the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred, to which reference may be considered necessary, shall pronounce judgment open Court, either at once or on some future day of which notice shall be given to the parties or their 
pleaders. 
[416] [(2) Where a written judgment is to be pronounced, it shall be sufficient if the points for determination, 
the decision thereon and the final order passed in the appeal are read out and it shall not be necessary for 
the Court to read out the whole judgment, but a copy of the whole judgment shall be made available for the

Proclamation of Sale 
(O. 21, R. 66) 
(Title) 
(1) Suit No. . . . . of 19. . . , decided by the . . . . . . . . . of . . . . . . . . . in which was plaintiff and was 
defendant—Notice is hereby given that, under rule 64 of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, an 
order has been passed by this Court for the sale of the attached property mentioned in the annexed schedule, in satisfaction of the claim of the decree-holder in the suit (1) mentioned in the margin, amounting with costs and interest up to date of sale to the sum of. 
The sale will be by public auction, and the property will be put up for sale in the lots specified in the schedule. 
The sale will be of the property of the judgment-debtors above-named as mentioned in the schedule below; 
and the liabilities and claims attaching to the said property, so far as they have been ascertained, are those 
specified in the schedule against each lot. 
In the absence of any order of postponement, the sale will be held by . . . . . . . . . at the monthly sale 
commencing at . . . . . . . . . o'clock on the . . . . . . . . . at . . . . . . . . . In the event, however, of the debt above specified and of the costs of the sale being tendered or paid before the knocking down of any lot, the sale will 
be stopped. 
At the sale the public generally are invited to bid, either personally or by duly authorized agent. No bid by, or 
on behalf of, the judgment-creditors above-mentioned, however, will be accepted, nor will any sale to them 
be valid without the express permission of the Court previously given. The following are the further. 
Conditions of sale 1. The particulars specified in the schedule below have been stated to the best of the information of the 
Court, but the Court will not be answerable for any error, mis-statement or omission in this proclamation. 2. The amount by which the biddings are to be increased shall be determined by the officer conducting the 
sale. In the event of any dispute arising as to the amount bid, or as to the bidder, the lot shall at once be 
again put up to auction. 
3. The highest bidder shall be declared to be the purchaser of any lot, provided always that he is legally 
qualified to bid, and provided that it shall be in the discretion of the Court or officer holding the sale to decline 
acceptance of the highest bid when the price offered appears so clearly inadequate as to make it advisable 
to do so. 
4. For reasons recorded, it shall be in the discretion of the officer conducting the sale to adjourn it subject 
always to the provisions of rule 69 of Order XXI. 5. In the case of movable property, the price of each lot shall be paid at the time of sale or as soon after as 
the officer holding the sale directs, and in default of payment the property shall forthwith be again put up and 
re-sold.
