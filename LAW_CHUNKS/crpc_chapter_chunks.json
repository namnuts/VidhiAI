    "chapter": "CHAPTER XVII: THE CHARGE",
    "text": "A.—Form of charges\n211. Contents of charge. —(1) Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the\naccused is charged.\n(2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in\nthe charge by that name only.\n(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition\nof the offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.\n(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be\nmentioned in the charge.\n(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by\nlaw to constitute the offence charged was fulfill ed in the particular case.\n(6) The charge shall be written in the language of the Court.\n(7) If the accused, having been previously convicted of any offence, is liable, by reason of such\nprevious conviction, to enhanced punishment, or to punishment of a di fferent kind, for a subsequent\noffence, and it is intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment\nwhich the Court may think fit to award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the previous\nconviction shall be stated in the charge; and if such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at\nany time before sentence is passed.\nIllustrations\n(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A's act fell within the definitio n of murder\ngiven in sections 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860); that it did not fall within any of the general exception s\nof the said Code; and that it did not fall within any of the five exceptions to section 300, or that, if it did fall within\nException 1, one or other of the three provis os to that exception applied to it.\n(b) A is charged under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B\nby means of an instrument for shooting. This is eq uivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by section 335\nof the said Code, and that the general exceptions did not apply to it.\n(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery or criminal intimidation, or using a false pro perty -mark.\nThe charge may state that A committed murder, or cheating, or theft, or extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or\nthat he used a false property -mark, without reference to the definition s, of those crimes contained in the Indian Penal Code\n(45 of 1860); but the sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance be referred to in the charge.\n(d) A is charged under section 184 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) with intentionally obstructing a sale of\nproperty offer ed for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words.\n212. Particulars as to time, place and person. —(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to\nthe time and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if a ny) against whom, or the thing (if any) in\n108\nrespect of which, it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter\nwith which he is charged.\n(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misapp ropriation of money\nor other movable property, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, describe\nthe movable property in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates\nbetween which the offence is alleged to have been committed, without specifying particular items or exact\ndates, and the charge so framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of\nsection 219:\nProvided that the time included between the first and last of s uch dates shall not exceed one year.\n213. When manner of committing offence must be stated. —When the nature of the case is such\nthat the particulars mentioned in sections 211 and 212 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the\nmatter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the\nalleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose .\nIllustrations\n(a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charg e need not set out the manner in\nwhich the theft was effected.\n(b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which A cheated B.\n(c) A is accused of giving false evidence at a given time and place. The char ge must set out that portion of the\nevidence given by A which is alleged to be false.\n(d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public functions at a given time and place.\nThe charge must set out the manner in which A obs tructed B in the discharge of his functions.\n(e) A is accused of the murder of B at a given time and place. The charge need not state the manner in which A\nmurdered B.\n(f) A is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save B from punishm ent. The charge must set out the\ndisobedience charged and the law infringed.\n214. Words in charge taken in sense of law under which offence is punishable. —In every charge\nwords used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sense at tached to them\nrespectively by the law under which such offence is punishable.\n215. Effect of errors. — No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated\nin the charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any stage of\nthe case as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has\noccasioned a failure of justice.\nIllustrations\n(a) A is charged under section 242 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), w ith “having been in possession of\ncounterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit ,” the word\n“fraudulently ” being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission , the error shall not\nbe regarded as material.\n(b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge or is set out\nincorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. T he Court may infer from this\nthat the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.\n(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many\n109\ntransactions between A and B, and A h ad no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no\ndefence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a\nmaterial error.\n(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda B aksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was\nHaidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never charged with any murder but one, and\nhad heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclus ively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer\nfrom these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.\n(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest hi m\nfor that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of\nKhoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from\nthis that A was misled, and that the error was material.\n216. Court may alter charge .—(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before\njudgment is pronounced.\n(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.\n(3) If the alte ration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not\nlikely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct\nof the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with\nthe trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge.\n(4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the\nopinion of the Court, to pr ejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a\nnew trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary.\n(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous\nsanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction\nhas been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added\ncharge is founded.\n217. Recall of witnesses when c harge altered. —Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the\nCourt after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed —\n(a) to recall or re -summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness\nwho may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that\nthe prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, desires to recall or re -examine such witness for the\npurpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice;\n(b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.\nB.—Joinder of charges\n218. Separate charges for distinct offences. —(1) For every distinct offence of which any person is\naccused there shall be a separate charge, an d every such charge shall be tried separately:\nProvided that where the accused person, by an application in writing, so desires and the Magistrate is\nof opinion that such person is not likely to be prejudiced thereby, the Magistrate may try together all or\nany number of the charges framed against such person.\n(2) Nothing in sub -section (1) shall affect the operation of the provisions of sections 219, 220, 221\nand 223.\n110\nIllustration\nA is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on anot her occasion. A must be separately charged and\nseparately tried for the theft and causing grievous hurt.\n219. Three offences of same kind within year may be charged together. —(1) When a person is\naccused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from\nthe first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the same person or not, he may be charged with,\nand tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding three.\n(2) Offences are of the same kind when they are punishable with the same amount of punishment\nunder the same section of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or of any special or local law:\nProvided that, for the purposes of this section, an offence punishable under section 379 of the Indian\nPena l Code (45 of 1860) shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an offence punishable\nunder section 380 of the said Code, and that an offence punishable under any section of the said Code, or\nof any special or local law, shall be deemed to be an o ffence of the same kind as an attempt to commit\nsuch offence, when such an attempt is an offence.\n220. Trial for more than one offence. —(1) If, in one series of acts so connected together as to form\nthe same transaction, more offences than one are committe d by the same person, he may be charged with,\nand tried at one trial for, every such offence.\n(2) When a person charged with one or more offences of criminal breach of trust or dishonest\nmisappropriation of property as provided in sub -section (2) of sectio n 212 or in sub -section (1) of section\n219, is accused of committing, for the purpose of facilitating or concealing the commission of that offence\nor those offences, one or more offences of falsification of accounts, he may be charged with, and tried at\none trial for, every such offence.\n(3) If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law\nin force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, the person accused of them may be\ncharged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences.\n(4) If several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence,\nconstitute when combined a different offence, the person accused of them may be charged with, and tr ied\nat one trial for the offence constituted by such acts when combined, and for any offence constituted by\nany one, or more, of such acts.\n(5) Nothing contained in this section shall affect section 71 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\nIllustrations t o sub -section (1)\n(a) A rescues B, a person in lawful custody, and in so doing causes grievous hurt to C, a constable in whose custody B\nwas.
